Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
