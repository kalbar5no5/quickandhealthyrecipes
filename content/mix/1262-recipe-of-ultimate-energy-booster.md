Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
