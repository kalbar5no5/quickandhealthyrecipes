Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
