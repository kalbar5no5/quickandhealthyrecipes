You can add the chopped herbs now or sprinkle them on the scrambled eggs before serving. Creamed Eggs on Toast is the perfect breakfast or brunch for when you have a bunch of hard-boiled eggs on hand, or when you don&#39;t have a lot in your pantry. Hard-boiled eggs are served in a creamy flavorful sauce and poured over crisp hot buttered toast. Whether you&#39;re making it by the slice, or in an oven-baked casserole, French toast is pan-fried bread that&#39;s been soaked in a mixture of eggs and dairy. That mixture is actually a custard, and it tastes best when you use full-fat dairy (whole milk, half-and-half, or equal parts milk and heavy cream). 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
