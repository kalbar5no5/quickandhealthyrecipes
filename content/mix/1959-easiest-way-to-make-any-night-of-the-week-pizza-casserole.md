Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
