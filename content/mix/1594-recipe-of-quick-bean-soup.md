Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
