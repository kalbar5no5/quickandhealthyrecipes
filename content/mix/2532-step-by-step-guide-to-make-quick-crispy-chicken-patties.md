Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
