Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
