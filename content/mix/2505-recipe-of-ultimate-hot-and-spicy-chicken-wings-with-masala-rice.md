How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine.
