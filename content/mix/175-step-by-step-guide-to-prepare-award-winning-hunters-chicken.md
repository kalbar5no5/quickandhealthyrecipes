Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
