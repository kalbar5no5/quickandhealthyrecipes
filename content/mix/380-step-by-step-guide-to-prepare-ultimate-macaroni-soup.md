Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
