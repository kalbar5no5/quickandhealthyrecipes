recipeingredient:
- "420 g bread flour"
- "340 mL filtered water"
- "8 g salt"
- "1 g dry yeast"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast and salt in the warm filtered water (around 35ºC)."
- "Introduce the flour and mix well, until there is no dry bits left. A silicone spatula works well to scrape the sides of the bowl."
- "Cover (with a damp towel, or cling film) and let rise in a warm place for 12 hours. Be aware that the dough will double in volume and make sure to use a bowl big enough for it not to overflow or stick to what you used to cover it. (See for yourself in the picture!)"
- "Pour out the dough gently on a lightly floured surface. Then fold it in thirds 4 times while stretching it lightly."
- "Prepare a bowl with olive oil and flour to prevent the dough from sticking (you might need to be generous!), then move the dough to that bowl."
- "Cover the dough then leave it for another 2 to 3 hours. Expect it to rise again!"
- "Put a big enough pot (cast iron or anything thick enough to retain good heat is best) in your oven, and preheat it to 250⁰C. You want to make sure the pot is VERY HOT or the bread will stick when you bake it."
- "Once the oven is ready, take out the pot, pour the dough in (you should hear a sizzling sound if it&#39;s hot enough), put the lid back on and bake for 30 minutes at 250⁰C."
- "Take the lid off, reduce the oven temperature to 230⁰C, then bake for another 15 minutes."
- "Your bread should be ready, with a nicely colored crust. Even though it&#39;s hard to resist, make sure to let it cool down before trying to slice it open!"
- "As I only eat 1 to 2 slices a day, a loaf can last me a few days. I usually slice the whole bread once it&#39;s cooled down, wrap slices individually in plastic wrap and store them in the freezer. A few minutes in the toaster in the morning and it&#39;s as good as fresh bread!"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
