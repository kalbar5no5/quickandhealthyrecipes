Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
