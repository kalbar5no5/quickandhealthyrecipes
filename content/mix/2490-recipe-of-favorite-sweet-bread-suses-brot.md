Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!
