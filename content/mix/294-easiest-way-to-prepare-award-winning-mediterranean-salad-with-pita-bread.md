Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
