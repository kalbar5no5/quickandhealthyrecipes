Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
