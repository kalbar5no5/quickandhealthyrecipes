Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
