Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
