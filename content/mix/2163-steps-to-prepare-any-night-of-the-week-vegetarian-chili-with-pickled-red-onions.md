Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
