How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
