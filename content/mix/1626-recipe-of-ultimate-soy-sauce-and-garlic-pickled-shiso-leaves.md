Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
