Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
