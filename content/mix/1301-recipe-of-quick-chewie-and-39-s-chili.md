Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
