Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
