Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
