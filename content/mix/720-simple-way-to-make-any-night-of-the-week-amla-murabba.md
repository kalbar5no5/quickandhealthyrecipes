Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
