Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
