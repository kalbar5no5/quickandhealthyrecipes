Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
