Some eggplant lasagna recipes ask you to grill the eggplant slices instead. While this imparts a nice smoky flavor, I find that grilling individual slices is too time-consuming; roasting is hands-off and more. Also known as Taco Lasagna or Mexican Casserole, this dish is layered with corn tortillas, ground beef, green chiles, beans, salsa, and cheese. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
