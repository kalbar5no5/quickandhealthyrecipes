Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
