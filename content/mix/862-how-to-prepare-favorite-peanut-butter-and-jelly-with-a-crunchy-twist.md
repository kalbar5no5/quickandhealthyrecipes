Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
