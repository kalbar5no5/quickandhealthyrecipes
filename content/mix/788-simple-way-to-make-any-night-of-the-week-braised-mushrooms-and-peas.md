Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
