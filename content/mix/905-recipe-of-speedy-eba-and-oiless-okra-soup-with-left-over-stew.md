Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
