Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
