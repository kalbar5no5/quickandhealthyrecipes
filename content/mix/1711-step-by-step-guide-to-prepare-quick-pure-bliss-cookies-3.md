Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
