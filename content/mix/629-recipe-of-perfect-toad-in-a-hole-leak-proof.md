Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
