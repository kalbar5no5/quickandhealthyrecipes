Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
