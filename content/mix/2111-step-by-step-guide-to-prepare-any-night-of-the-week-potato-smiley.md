Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
