How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
