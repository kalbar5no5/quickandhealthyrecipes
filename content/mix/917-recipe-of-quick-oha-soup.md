Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
