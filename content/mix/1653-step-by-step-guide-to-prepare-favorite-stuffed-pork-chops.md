Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
