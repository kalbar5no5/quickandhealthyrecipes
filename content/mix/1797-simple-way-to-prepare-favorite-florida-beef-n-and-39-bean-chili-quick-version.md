Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
