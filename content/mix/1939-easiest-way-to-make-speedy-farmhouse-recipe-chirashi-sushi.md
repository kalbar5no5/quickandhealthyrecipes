Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
