Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
