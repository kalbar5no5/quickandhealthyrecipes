Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
