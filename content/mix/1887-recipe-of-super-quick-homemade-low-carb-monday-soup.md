Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
