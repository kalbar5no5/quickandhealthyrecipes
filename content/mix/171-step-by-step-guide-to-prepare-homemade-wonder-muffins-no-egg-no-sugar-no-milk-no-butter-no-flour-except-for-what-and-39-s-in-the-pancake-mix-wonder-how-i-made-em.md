These Sugar-free and eggless banana muffins are great for breakfast, snack, or dessert. The recipe uses the natural sweetness of ripe bananas and a little honey for extra sweetness. Eggless baking is very common in India as many pure vegetarians don&#39;t take eggs in cakes and bread too. Place wet ingredients including the &#34;egg&#34; in medium bowl, and stir to combine.

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
