Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
