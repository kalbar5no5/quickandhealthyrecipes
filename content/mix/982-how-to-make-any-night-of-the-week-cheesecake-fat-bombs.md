Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
