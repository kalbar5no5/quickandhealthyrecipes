Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
