Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
