Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
