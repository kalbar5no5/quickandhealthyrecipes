Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
