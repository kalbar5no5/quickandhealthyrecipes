Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
