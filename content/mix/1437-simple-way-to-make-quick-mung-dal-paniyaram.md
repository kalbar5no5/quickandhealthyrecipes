Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
