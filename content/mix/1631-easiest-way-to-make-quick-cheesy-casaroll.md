Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
