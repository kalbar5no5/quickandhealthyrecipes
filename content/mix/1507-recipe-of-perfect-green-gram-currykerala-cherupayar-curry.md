Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
