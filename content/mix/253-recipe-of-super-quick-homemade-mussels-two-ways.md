recipeingredient:
- "1 Ke Mussels"
- " In broth"
- "2-3 inches Ginger"
- "1/4 head garlic"
- "1 medium onion"
- "2-3 stevia 2g packets or 12 Sprite"

- "2 Tbsp Cooking oil"
- "to taste Pepper"
- " Water"

- "1/4 head garlic"
- "1/8 bar butter"
- " Any cheese in fridge quick melt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove beard and clean mussels well with a toothbrush under running water. Scrape off any white spots with a knife."
- "In a pot, heat oil and saut√© the onions, garlic and ginger."
- "Once onions are translucent, place 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, drop in mussels, add enough water to reach the mussels on top of the pot (water would depend on your pot size. Less water = more flavour). Sprinkle some fresh ground pepper and a dash of salt. Cover."
- "Simmer until shells open. Remove any scum rising to the top. Remove any shells that did not open. At this point you can choose shells for your Baked Mussels dish and set aside."
- "MAKING YOUR BROTH DISH: Continue simmering the pot. Add your fish sauce and Sprite or stevia (if sugar free is preferred). Taste and adjust according to desired saltiness (add more fish sauce) and ginger spiciness. Once achieved you can add your chilli leaves and simmer 2-3 minutes more. Taste and notice the difference, delicious!"
- "MAKING YOUR BAKED DISH: In an oven pan arrange your half shells. Add or insert butter slices to each mussel. Top with chopped garlic and a slice or shredded cheese. Another way is to add your garlic to mashed butter. This cooks the garlic better when you top it to the mussels."
- "Heat in oven until butter bubbles and cheese melts. Remember, this is already cooked so don&#39;t leave it too long, meat might get tough. (In picture: the brown ones, I added Korean bean/chilli paste just to try it). üëç"

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
