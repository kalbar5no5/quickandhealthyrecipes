Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
