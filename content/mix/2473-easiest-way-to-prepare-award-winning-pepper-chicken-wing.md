Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
