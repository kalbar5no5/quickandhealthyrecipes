Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
