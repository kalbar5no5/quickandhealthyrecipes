Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
