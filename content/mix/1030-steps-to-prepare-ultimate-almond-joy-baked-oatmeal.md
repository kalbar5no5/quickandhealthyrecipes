Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
