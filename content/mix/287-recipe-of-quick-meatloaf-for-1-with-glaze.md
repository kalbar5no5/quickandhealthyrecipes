Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
