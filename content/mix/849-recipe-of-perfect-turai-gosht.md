Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
