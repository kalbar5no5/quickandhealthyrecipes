Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
