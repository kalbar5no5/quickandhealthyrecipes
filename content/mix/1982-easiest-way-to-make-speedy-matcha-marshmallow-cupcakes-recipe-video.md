Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
