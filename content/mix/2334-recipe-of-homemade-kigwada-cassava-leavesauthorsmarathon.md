Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them.
