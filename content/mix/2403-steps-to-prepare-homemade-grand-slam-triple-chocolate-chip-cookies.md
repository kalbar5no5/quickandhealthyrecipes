How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
