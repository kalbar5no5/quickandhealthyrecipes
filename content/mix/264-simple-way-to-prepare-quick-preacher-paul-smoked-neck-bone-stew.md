Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
