Hello everybody, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, shawarma. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Shawarma is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Shawarma is something that I've loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Shawarma (/ ʃ ə ˈ w ɑːr m ə /; Arabic: شاورما ‎) is a dish in Middle Eastern cuisine consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Originally made of lamb or mutton, today&#39;s shawarma may also be chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates. Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have shawarma using 9 ingredients and 1 steps. Here is how you cook that.

Shawarma refers to the Middle Eastern method cooking where thin slices of meat, most traditionally lamb, are stack on a vertical spit and slowly rotate in front of a fire or other heat source. Shawarma Sauce: Add garlic to the bowl of a food processor and process until chopped. Add tahini and pulse to combine. With the machine running, slowly add cold water until frothy. True shawarma is cooked with stacked, spice-marinated meats- lamb, turkey, chicken, beef, or a mix of meats- on a vertical rotisserie machine or spit. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
