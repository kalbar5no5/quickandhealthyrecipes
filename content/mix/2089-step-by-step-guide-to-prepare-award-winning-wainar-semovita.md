Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
