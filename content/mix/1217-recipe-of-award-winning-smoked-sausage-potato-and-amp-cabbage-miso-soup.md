Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
