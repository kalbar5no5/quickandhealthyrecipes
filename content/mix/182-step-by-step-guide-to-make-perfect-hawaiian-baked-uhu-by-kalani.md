Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
