Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
