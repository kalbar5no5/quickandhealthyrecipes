On the other hand, this creamy seafood salad is a lot different. It is made with a &#34; salsa rosa,&#34; which is a pink Spanish cocktail sauce that is basically a mix of a homemade mayonnaise with ketchup and a few other additions. In a large bowl, combine squid, octopus, tomatoes, onions, scallions, garbanzo beans, and olives.

One of my favorite dishes in the whole world is Mexican octopus salad, or &#34;ensalada de pulpo&#34;, with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, and chiles. It&#39;s fabulous as a side or topped over tacos or tostadas. Galicia is a seafood lover&#39;s paradise. Surrounded on two sides by the Atlantic Ocean and streaked with freshwater rivers and saltwater inlets, this northwestern Spanish province is the reigning champion of Spanish seafood. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
