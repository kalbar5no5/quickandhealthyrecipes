Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!
