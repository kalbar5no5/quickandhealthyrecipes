Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
