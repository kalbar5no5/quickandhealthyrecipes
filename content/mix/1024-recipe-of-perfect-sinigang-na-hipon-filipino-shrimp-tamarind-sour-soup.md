Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
