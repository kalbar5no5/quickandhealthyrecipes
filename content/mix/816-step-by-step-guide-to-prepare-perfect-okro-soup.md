Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body.
