Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
