Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
