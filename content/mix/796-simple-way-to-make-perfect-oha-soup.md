Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!
