Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
