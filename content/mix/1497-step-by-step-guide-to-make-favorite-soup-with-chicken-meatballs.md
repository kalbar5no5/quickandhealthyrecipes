Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
