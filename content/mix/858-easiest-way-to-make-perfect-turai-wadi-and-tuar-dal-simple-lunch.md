How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
