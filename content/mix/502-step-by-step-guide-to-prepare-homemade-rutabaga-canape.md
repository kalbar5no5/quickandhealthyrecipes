Rutabaga is known as &#34;Swiss turnip&#34;. When I had guests coming over, I made a double batch and they were gobbled up in a flash. A sworn lover of parsnips, this is but one more way to fix them.

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
