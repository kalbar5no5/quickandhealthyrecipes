Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood.

The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
