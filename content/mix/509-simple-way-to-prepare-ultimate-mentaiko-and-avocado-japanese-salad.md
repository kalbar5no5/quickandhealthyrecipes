Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
