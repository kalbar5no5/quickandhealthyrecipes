Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
