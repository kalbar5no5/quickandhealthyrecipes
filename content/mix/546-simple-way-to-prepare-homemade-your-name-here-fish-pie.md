This is a paid for Ad. This quick and delicious fish pie is full of flavour and lighter than traditional recipes. The usual white sauce is replaced with a c. We do add a third seafood to the fish pie to mix up the texture a little, and our preference here is for shrimp. Because it cooks quickly, you don&#39;t want to use a small variety and risk overcooked or rubbery lumps: opt for medium or large, and if you find extra-large or jumbo, these will work well cut into slightly larger than bite-size pieces. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
