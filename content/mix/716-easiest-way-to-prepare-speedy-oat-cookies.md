Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
