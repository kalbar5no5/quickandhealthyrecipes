Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
