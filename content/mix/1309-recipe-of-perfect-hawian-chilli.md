This chilli pepper is small and similar to the Tabasco - small and packs quite a punch. Originally the pepper spread all over Hawaii, because birds would eat the chilli pods and later the seeds would be transferred to the ground via the birds feces, the seeds. A friend told me about how she had found a Hawaiian Chicken Chili. I decided to challenge myself to come up with a Hawaiian Beef Chili.

A friend told me about how she had found a Hawaiian Chicken Chili. I decided to challenge myself to come up with a Hawaiian Beef Chili. I find it more difficult to make beef salty, spicy and sweet without being overpowering, this came out wonderfully spicy. Another great recipe from my Aunt Toni. Unusual but wonderfully tasty as was proved this Fall when my DH and I won a chili cook-off with it. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
