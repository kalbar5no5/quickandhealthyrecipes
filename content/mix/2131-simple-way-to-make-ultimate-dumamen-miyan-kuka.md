Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
