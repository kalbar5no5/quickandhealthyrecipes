How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body.
