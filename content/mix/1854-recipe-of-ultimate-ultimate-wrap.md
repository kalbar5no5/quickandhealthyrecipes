Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
