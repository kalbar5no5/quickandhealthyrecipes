Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
