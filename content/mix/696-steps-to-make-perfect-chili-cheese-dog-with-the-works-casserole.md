Beef franks, chili and beans, tortillas and Cheddar cheese form the layers of this deceptively simple and unnusual casserole. I make ours with the chili without beans and add crushed corn chips on top. Great addition to a football party which kids will be attending. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
