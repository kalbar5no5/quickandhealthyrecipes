Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
