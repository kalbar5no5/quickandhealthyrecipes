Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
