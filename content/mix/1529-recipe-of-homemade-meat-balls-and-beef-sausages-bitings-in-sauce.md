Since I usually cook my small to medium sized meatballs in red sauce I don&#39;t pre-brown them. I also use minced onions and not chopped. Gently heat the sugar and fish sauce in a non-stick saucepan until the sugar has melted and mixture starts to thicken. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
