Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
