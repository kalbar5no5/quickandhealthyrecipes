Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
