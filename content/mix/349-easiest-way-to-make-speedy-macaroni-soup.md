How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
