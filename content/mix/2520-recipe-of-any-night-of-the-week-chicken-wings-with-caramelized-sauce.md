Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
