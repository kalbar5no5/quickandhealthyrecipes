recipeingredient:
- "1 large rib eye steak 115"
- "1 tbsp vegetable oil"
- " Rub"
- "1 tbsp ground coffee"
- "1 tbsp kosher salt"
- "1 tbsp coarse ground black pepper"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1 tsp ground cumin"
- "1 tsp hot red pepper flakes"
- "2 tsp dark brown sugar"
- " Sauce"
- "1 cup chocolate stout"
- "1/2 cup beef stock"
- "1 stick thyme"
- "1 tbsp unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the coffee, salt, paprika, peppers &amp; cumin together and toast lightly in pan until fragrant (alternatively you can toast whole spices then grind). Mix the spices with the sugar to make the rub"
- "Spread the rub all over the steak and let sit for awhile, if you do it the night before you&#39;ll have stronger flavor but if you do it right before serving it&#39;ll be good, too. (If you pre-rub and set it in the fridge, be sure to bring it up to room temperature before searing, so you do not shock the meat.)"
- "Heat a cast iron pan until it&#39;s really really hot -- a drop of water flicked into the pan should sizzle and bounce. Add vegetable oil, wait a few seconds until the oil heats up, then place the steak in the pan. It should sizzle; leave it there, do not touch it at all for 3-4 minutes. It should be browning on the bottom. Then place it under a hot broiler and broil to medium rare or desired doneness."
- "Remove the steak and let rest on a warm plate, cover with aluminum foil."
- "Add the thyme sprig to the pan and let it saute a bit till it gets nice and fragrant. Pour in the chocolate stout and deglaze the pan. Add the beef broth, whisk together and reduce by half over medium heat."
- "Remove the thyme sprig and whisk in the butter. Season to taste."
- "Slice the steak on the bias and drizzle the sauce over top. This is YUMMY with creamed spinach and hash browns or baked potato and a nice big salad."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
