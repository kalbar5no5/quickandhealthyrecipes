Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
