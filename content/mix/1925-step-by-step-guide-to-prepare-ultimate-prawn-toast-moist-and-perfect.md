How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
