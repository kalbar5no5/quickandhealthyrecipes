Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
