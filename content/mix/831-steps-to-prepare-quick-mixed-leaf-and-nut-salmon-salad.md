Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!
