Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
