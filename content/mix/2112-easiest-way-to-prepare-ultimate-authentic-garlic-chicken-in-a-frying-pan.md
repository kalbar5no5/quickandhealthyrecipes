Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body.
