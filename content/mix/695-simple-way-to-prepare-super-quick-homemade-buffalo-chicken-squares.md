Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
