Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
