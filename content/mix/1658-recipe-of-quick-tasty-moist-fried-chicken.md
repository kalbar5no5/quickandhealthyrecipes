Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
