Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
