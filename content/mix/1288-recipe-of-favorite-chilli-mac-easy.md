It&#39;s true that chili mac is already a Mexican-inspired dish, but this version gets even closer to its roots with authentic Mexican ingredients including chorizo and poblano peppers. It&#39;s also quick (as long as you&#39;ve got the pepper-roasting down) and easy--a true one-pot meal.

This Easy Chili Mac is a one pot meal that the whole family will love, that is made with ground beef, chili beans, macaroni and topped with cheese! I will be honest chili can sometimes be quite the controversial topic, pasta, no pasta, beans, no beans, spicy, not spicy etc. If this is not your type of chili no need to stick around or comment. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
