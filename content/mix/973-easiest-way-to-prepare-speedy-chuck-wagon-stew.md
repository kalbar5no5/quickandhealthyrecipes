How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
