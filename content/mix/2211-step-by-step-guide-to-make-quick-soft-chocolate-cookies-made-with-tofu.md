Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
