How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
