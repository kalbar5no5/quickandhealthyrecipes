Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
