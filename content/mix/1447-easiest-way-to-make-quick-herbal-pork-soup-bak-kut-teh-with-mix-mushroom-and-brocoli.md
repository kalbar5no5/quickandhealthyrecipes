Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
