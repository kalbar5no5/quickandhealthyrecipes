Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
