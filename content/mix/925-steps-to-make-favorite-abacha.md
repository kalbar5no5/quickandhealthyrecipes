Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
