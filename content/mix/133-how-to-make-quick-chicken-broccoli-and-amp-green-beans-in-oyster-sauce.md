Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
