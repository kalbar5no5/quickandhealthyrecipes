How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
