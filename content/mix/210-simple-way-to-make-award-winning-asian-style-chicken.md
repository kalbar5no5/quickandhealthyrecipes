The chicken was tender and moist but I credit Hubs&#39; expertise with grilling for that! Served with Classic Fried Rice and Easy Bok Choy this was a delicious darned near memorable meal and beautiful in its presentation. (Note: I didn&#39;t see heating the marinade ingredients as necessary so I didn&#39;t bother with that step. I just used the easier more.

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
