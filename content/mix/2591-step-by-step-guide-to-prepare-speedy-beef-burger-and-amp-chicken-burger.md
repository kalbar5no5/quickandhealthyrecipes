Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
