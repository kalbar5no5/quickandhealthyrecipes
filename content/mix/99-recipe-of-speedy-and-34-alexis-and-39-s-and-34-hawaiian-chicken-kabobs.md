Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
