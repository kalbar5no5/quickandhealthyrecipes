Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
