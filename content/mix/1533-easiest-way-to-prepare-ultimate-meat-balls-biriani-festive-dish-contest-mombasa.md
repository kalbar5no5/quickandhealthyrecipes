Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
