Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
