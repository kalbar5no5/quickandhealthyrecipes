Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
