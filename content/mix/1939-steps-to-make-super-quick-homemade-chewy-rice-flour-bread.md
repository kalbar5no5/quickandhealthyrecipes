Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
