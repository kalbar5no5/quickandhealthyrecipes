Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
