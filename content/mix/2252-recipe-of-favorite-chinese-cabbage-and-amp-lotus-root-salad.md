Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
