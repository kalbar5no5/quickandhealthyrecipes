Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
