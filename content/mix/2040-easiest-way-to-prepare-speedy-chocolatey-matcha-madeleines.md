Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
