Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
