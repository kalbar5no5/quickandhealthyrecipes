Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
