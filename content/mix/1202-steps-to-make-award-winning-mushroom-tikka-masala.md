Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
