Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
