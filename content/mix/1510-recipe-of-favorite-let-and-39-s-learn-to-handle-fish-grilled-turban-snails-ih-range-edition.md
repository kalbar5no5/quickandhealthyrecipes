Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
