Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
