Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body.
