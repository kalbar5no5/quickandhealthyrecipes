Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
