Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
