Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
