Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
