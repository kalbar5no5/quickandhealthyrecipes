Spicy Stuffed Mushrooms Recipe photo by Taste of Home From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sisig is a Filipino dish made from parts of pig head and chicken liver, usually seasoned with calamansi, onions and chili peppers. It originates from the region of Pampanga in the island of Luzon. Pair brown rice with mushrooms, and season the dish with onions and curry powder, a blend of coriander, fenugreek, turmeric and red pepper. Add a pinch of nutmeg to a veloute sauce made from mushrooms, green onions, milk and chicken broth, and serve it over chicken or fish. Saut√©ing is a quick and easy way to impart flavor, and no seasoning will do as much for a mushroom dish as a hearty dose of salt and pepper. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
