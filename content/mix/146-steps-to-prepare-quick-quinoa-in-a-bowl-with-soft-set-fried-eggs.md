Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
