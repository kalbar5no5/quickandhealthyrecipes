It keeps forever in refrigerator too. This sauce will only barely coat the spaghetti and is not meant as a thick sauce such as marinara and more like Japanese style pesto sauce. This is the recipe for sweet and sour sauce used in many Mom and Pop Chinese Restaurants. There are plenty of more complicated, more authentic and just plain better recipes out there, but try this just one time and I think you will find this simple one is the one you see and use most often.

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
