Fusilli [fuËˆzilli], commonly known as Rotini in the U. S., are a variety of pasta that are formed into corkscrew or helical shapes. The word fusilli presumably comes from fuso (&#34;spindle&#34;), as traditionally it is &#34;spun&#34; by pressing and rolling a small rod over the thin strips of pasta to wind them around it in a corkscrew shape. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
