Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
