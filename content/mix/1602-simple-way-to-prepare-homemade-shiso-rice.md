Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
