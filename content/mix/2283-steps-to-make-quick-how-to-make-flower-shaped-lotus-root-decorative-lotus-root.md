Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
