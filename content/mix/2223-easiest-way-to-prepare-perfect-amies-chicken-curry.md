Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
