Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
