Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
