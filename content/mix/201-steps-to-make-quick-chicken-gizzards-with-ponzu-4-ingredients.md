Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
