How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
