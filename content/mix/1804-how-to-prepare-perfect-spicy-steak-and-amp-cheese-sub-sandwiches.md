recipeinstructions:

- "Broil until cheese is melted, bubbly and starting to brown."
- "Serve immediately!"
- "Tips- Any cut of steak will do. I partially freeze mine, then cut it in extremely thin slices. You can also get your butcher to shave it for you. My favorite steak to use for this is ribeye .   To make it spicer add additional red pepper flakes or an additional jalapeno.   If you want it spicy leave the seeds in the jalapeno, if you want to tame the spicy just a bit remove the seeds and cut back on the red pepper flakes."

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
