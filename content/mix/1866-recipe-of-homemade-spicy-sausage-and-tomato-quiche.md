Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
