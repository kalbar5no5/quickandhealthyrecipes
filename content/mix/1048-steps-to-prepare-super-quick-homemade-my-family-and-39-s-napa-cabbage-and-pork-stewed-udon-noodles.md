Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
