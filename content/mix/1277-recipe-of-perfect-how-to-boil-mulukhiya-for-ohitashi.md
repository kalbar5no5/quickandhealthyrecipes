Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
