Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
