Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
