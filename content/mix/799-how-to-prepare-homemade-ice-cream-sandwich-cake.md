Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood.

Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
