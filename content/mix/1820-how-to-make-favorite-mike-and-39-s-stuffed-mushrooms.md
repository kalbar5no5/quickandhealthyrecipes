Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
