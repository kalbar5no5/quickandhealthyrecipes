Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
