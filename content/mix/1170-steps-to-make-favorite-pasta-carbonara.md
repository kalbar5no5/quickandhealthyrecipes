Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
