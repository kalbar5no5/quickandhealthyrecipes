Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
