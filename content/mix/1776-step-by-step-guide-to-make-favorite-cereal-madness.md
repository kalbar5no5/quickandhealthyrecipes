Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
