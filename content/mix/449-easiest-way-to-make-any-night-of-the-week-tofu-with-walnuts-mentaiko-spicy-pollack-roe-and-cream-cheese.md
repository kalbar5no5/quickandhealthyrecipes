- "Add the shredded nori seaweed and it&#39;s done.  If you don&#39;t have walnuts, other nuts will do too. If you roast them in a dry pan beforehand, they&#39;ll taste great."

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
