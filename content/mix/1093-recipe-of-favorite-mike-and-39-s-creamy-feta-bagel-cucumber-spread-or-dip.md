Sure to be a hit at a Superbowl party or BBQ. &gt;&gt;&gt;Get the recipe here Combine the cream cheese with all the other ingredients in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture reaches the consistency you want: it can be chunky, with larger pieces of the veggies, or you can keep going until it&#39;s very mixed together. Transfer the spread to a container and store, covered in plastic wrap, in the fridge. Feta cheese whips up into a smooth, creamy spread when blended with olive oil in the food processor. The Greeks like to flavor it with garlic, mint and pickled peppers to make a piquant dip for pita bread. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
