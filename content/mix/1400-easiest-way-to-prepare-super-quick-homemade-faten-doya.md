Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
