Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
