How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
