recipeingredient:
- "5 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "3 level tablespoons Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Honey"
- "2 tbsp Lemon juice"
- "280 ml Water"
- "5 grams Powdered gelatin"
recipeinstructions:
- "Thoroughly wash the shiso leaves. Place the gelatin directly into a pot, and soak in 1 tablespoon of water (not listed)."
- "Stack the shiso leaves, roll them up, and julienne. Turn the shredded leaves 90° and finely mince."
- "Heat the pot over low heat, add the shiso from Step 2, 200 ml of water and sugar, and stir continuously. Once it starts lightly simmering from the bottom of the pot, then boil down for about 1 minute, and turn off the heat."
- "Mix the remaining 80 ml water mixed with lemon juice and honey to the pot, and stir well. Adding lemon juice directly prevents the jello from easily solidifying."
- "Place into a container and chill in the fridge. After it has solidified a bit after about an hour, the shiso leaves tend to sink to the bottom, so give it a good stir with a spoon."
- "After chilling for 2 or 3 more hours, you will have refreshing and invigorating jiggly jello."
- "This tastes great as-is, but crushing it up and pouring in cider is also delicious."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
