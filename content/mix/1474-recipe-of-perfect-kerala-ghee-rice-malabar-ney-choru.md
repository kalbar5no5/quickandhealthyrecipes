Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
