How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
