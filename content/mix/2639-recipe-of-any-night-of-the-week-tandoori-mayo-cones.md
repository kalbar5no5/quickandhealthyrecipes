I don&#39;t know why it is but the tandoori chicken in restaurants in North America is just not good. Maybe they use mass produced tandoori paste.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
