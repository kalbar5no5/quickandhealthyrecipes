Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
