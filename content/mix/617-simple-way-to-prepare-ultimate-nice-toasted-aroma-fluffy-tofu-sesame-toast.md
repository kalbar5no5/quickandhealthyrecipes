Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
