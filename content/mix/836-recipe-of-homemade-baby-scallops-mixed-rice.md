Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
