Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
