Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
