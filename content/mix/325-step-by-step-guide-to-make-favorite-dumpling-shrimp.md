How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
