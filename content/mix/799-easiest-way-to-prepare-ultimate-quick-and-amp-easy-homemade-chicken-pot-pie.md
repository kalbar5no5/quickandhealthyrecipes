Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
