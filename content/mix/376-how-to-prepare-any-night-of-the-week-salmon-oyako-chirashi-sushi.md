Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
