How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
