Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
