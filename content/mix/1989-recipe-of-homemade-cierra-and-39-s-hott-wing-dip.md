Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
