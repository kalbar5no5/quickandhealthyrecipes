Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
