Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
