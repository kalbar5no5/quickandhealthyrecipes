Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
