Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
