Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
