Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
