Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
