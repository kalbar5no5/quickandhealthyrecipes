Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
