Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
