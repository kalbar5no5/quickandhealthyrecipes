recipeingredient:
- "1 kg pork belly bone in skin on"
- "3-4 large garlic cloves"
- "2 tbsp. dried marjoram"
- "2 tsp black or garlic pepper"
- "3 tbsp. black bean paste or sauce"
- "2 tbsp. dark soy sauce"
- "3 tbsp. runny honey"
- "2 tsp liquid smoke optional"
- "1 medium onion"
- "1/2 cup dry sherry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the garlic into slivers. With a sharp knife make incisions in the pork belly, on all sides except the skin (unless it’s scored, which I don’t see many benefits of; unscored skin peels off easier for carving) and push the garlic slivers in, as many as you can."
- "Season the pork belly all over generously with the marjoram and pepper and drizzle with the black bean paste, soy sauce and honey. Rub the meat with the sauces on all sides and leave to marinate for at least an hour - overnight would best."
- "Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas 3. Slice the onion, peeled or unpeeled, into 4 rings, place them on the bottom of a roasting tray and sit the pork belly on the onion, skin side up. Pour the sherry into the tray, tent it with foil so that it’s sealed but doesn’t touch the meat."
- "Roast for 2 ½ hours, turn the heat up to 180C/350F/gas 4, take the foil off and roast for another hour, until the skin is crisp and charred around the edges. Let the meat rest for 15 minutes before carving."

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
