Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
