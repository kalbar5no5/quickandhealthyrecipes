Great recipe for Salty Tsukune (Chicken Patties) with Japanese Leeks. My children love chicken patties, but I want them to eat vegetables, so I made this recipe. It also has a very nice sesame oil aroma! It is very nice if you use thicker Japanese leeks, but it takes time to cook all the way.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have salty tsukune (chicken patties) with japanese leeks using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

Tsukune are Japanese chicken meat balls with a kind of Teriyaki sauce and are popular at Yakitori restaurants. Often times, small Tsukune meat balls are skewered on bamboo sticks and grilled on the coal barbecue grill, but they don&#39;t have to be. Here they are shaped like small hamburger steaks and cooked in a frying pan. The tsukune patties will be cold and tough by the time you eat it for lunch, so I added some silken tofu thinking that it might make the patties a little softer.

The minced meat (ground meat) does not have to be chicken, it could be pork or even fish. 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
