- "Coarsely chop the Japanese leek to mix with the ground meat. You can use the core and shriveled parts for this. Finely chop the ginger and garlic."
- "For the briefly simmered greens: You can use small scallions or leafy greens. A fatter leek is better-tasting than the small ones. You can use the green part of the scallions as well. Cut it into long strips."
- "Flavoring ingredients - Mix the ingredients well and set aside.  It should look like this."
- "Use 2 kinds of Korean red chili pepper if possible. The powdered type will give the dish a nice color. If you can only find one kind, double the amount of what you have.  Japanese red chili pepper cannot be substituted ."
- "In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, the ☆ ingredients and the white pepper.  Mix the grainy meat to loosen up its fibers by kneading in the ☆ ingredients."
- "Once it&#39;s well mixed, drizzle in a small amount of sesame oil and mix it evenly, so that when the meat is cooked, it doesn&#39;t get crumbly."
- "Start sautéing. First, add the meat in a cold skillet.  If the meat does not have enough fat, drizzle in a small amount of the sesame oil little by little while sautéing the meat."
- "Once the oil comes out, turn up the heat and cook it though.   This way, the ground meat will cook up without crumbling."
- "When the meat is cooked through, add the sardine powder. This ingredient is very important.  When it starts to cook, it will smell wonderful! Always use dried sardines instead of bonito flakes for Korean cooking."
- "Crumble the tofu with your hands and add to the skillet. No need to drain the tofu. Pour in 1.5 cups of water and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low when it comes to a boil."
- "Remove any scum or grease thoroughly and pour the flavoring ingredients. Using a wooden spoon, stir the skillet as if scratching the bottom of the skillet without flipping the tofu."
- "Soft tofu will fall apart easily in rapidly boiling liquid, so reduce heat to low and simmer it for about 10 minutes."
- "For adults, add more red chili pepper. It doens&#39;t taste that hot with the additional pepper. If you like spicy food, add as much as you like!"

- "P.S. This is the gochujang that I am using at home. It&#39;s not too hot nor too harsh or bitter. It&#39;s easy to adjust the taste, plus it&#39;s easy to get!"
- "This is &#34;Pan-fried tofu with gochujang&#34;.  It&#39;s easy and budget-friendly. Give it a try."

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
