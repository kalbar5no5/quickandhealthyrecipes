Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
