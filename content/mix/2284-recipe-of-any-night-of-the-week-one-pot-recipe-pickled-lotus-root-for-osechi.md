Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
