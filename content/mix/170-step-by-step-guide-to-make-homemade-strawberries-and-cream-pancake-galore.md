Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
