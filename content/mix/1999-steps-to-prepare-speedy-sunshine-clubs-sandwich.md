Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
