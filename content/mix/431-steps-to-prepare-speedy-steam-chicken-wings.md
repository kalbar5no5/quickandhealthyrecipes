Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
