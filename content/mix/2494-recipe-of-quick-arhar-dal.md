Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine.
