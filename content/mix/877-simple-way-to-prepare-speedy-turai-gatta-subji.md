How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
