How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
