Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
