Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
