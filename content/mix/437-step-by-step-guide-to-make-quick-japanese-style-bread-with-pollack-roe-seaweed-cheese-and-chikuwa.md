Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
