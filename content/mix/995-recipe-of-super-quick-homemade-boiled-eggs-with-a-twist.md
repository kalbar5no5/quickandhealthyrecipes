Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
