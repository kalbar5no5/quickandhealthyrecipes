Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
