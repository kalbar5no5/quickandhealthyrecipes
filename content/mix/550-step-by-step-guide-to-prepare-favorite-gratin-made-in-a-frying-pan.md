Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
