How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
