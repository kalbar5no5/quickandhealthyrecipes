Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
