Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
