Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
