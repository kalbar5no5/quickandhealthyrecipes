Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
