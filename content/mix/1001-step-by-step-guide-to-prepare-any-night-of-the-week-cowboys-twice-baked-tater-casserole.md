How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
