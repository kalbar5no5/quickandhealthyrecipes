Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
