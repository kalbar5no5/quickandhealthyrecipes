Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
