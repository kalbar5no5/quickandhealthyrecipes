Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
