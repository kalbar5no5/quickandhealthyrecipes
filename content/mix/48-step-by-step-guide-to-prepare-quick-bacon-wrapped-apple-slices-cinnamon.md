Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
