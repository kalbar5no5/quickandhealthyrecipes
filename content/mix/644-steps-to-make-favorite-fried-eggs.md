How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
