Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
