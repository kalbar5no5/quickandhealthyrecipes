At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood.

Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
