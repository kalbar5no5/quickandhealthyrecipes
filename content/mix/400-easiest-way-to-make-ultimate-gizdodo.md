Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
