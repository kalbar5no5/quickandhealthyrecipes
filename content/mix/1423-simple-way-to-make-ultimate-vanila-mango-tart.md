Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, vanila mango tart. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Scrape the vanilla bean seeds into the milk then add the scraped bean to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil just until the milk starts to foam. Remove the milk mixture from the heat, take out the vanilla bean and then very slowly whisk the milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling. Perfectly flaky and buttery tart shell crusts are filled with an amazing layer of vanilla and white chocolate cream, then topped with fresh and sweet mango dices sprinkled with fragrant lime zest. The key to this tart is a firm, sweet, perfectly ripe mangoâ€”and you&#39;ll get the most perfect treat to make for this summer.

Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine.
