Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
