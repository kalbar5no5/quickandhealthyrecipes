Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
