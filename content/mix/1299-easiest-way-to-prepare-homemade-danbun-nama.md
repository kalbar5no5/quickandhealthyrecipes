Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
