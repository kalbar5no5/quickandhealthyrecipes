Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
