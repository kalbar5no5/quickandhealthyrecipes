How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
