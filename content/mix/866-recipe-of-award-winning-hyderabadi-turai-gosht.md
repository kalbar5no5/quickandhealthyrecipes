recipeingredient:
- "1/2 kg Ridge Gourd or Turai"
- "400 gm Mutton bonein"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "1 tsp Red chilli powder"
- "1/2 tsp Turmeric powder"
- "1 tsp Cumin powder"
- "2 Green chillies finely chopped"
- "1/4 cup Coriander leaves finely chopped"
- "3 tbsp Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and wash the vegetable thoroughly. Slice it thinly and keep aside. To a pressure cooker, add Oil and saute the Onions on a low heat. Also add Ginger garlic paste and Green chillies. Saute them all until done. The raw smell of the onions should diminish. Now add the rest of the spices along with the Mutton bone-in. Mix well and keep cooking that on a low heat with a lid on for nearly 5 minutes. After the time&#39;s up, close the lid of the cooker after adding in some water. Do not add more of it"
- "Pressure cook this for 7-8 whistles or until done. Let the steam settle down on it&#39;s own before opening the lid. Now is the time to add sliced Ridge Gourd or Turai. Since this veggie is done pretty much quickly. Keep an eye on it. Keep the heat on a high only. Adjust Salt and throw in some Chopped Coriander leaves too. It will be done in 10 minutes. As it leaves a lot of water, do not add much while cooking the Mutton."
- "Keep the heat on a high and cook until all the water that has been released dries up. Keep checking in between and mix with light hands only taking care not to break the tender Turai slices. Garnish with some Sun dried Fenugreek Leaves or Kasuri methi. It gives a lovely flavour."
- "Turai is the Hyderabadi wors for Ridge Gourd. And this is the most loved side dish. It goes well with both Rotis and Rice. It can also be served with Phulkas and Pooris. I usually serve it with Boiled Rice and Khatti Daal. This combo is great. It can be cooked without Mutton too. In that case, add finely chopped Tomatoes. Do not add more water to this veggie while cooking. Try it for your loved ones and friends. Happy Cooking Everyone!"

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
