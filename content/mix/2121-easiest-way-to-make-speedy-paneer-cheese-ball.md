Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
