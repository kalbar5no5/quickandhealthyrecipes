Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
