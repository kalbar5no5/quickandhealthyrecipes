Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
