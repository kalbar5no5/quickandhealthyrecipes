Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
