Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
