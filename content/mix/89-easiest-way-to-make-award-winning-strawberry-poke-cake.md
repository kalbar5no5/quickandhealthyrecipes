Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
