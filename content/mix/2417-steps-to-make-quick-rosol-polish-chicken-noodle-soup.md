Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
