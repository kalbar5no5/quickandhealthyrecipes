Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
