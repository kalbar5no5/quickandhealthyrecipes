Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
