Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
