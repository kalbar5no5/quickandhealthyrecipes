Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
