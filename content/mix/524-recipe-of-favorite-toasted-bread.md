Place bread slices in a toaster oven and toast until butter is bubbling and the edges of bread are brown. Great for a side to lunch or a snack in and of itself, a toasted cheese or a cheese toast is a simple slice of bread topped with melted cheese. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
