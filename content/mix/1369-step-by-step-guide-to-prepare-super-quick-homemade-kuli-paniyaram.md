Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
