Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
