Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
