Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
