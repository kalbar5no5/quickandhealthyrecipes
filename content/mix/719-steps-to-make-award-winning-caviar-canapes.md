How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
