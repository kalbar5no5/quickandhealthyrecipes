Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
