Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
