Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
