Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
