Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
