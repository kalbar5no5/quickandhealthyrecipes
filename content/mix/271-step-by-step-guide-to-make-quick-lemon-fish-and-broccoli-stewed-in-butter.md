Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
