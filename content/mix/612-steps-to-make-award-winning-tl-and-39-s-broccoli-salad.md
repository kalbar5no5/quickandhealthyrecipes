Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
