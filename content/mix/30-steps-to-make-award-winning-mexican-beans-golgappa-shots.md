Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
