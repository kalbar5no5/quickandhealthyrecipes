Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
