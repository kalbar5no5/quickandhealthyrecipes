Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
