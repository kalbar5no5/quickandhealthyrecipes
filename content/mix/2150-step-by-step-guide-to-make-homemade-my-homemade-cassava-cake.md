Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
