Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
