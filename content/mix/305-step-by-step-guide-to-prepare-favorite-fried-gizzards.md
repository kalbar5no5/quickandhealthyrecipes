Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
