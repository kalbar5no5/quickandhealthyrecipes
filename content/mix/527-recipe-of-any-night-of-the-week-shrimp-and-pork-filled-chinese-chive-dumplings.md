Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
