Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
