Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
