Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
