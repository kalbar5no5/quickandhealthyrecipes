Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
