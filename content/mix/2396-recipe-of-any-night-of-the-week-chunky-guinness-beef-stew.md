This traditional Irish stew recipe can be cooked in the crock pot or oven. It freezes really well and can also be used as the base for a beef and Guinness pie. This hearty beef stew is made with lean boneless chuck that&#39;s cooked with carrots, parsnips and turnips and flavored with dark beer. But in many parts of the world including here in Australia and North America, Guinness Stew is more commonly made with beef.

This hearty beef stew is made with lean boneless chuck that&#39;s cooked with carrots, parsnips and turnips and flavored with dark beer. But in many parts of the world including here in Australia and North America, Guinness Stew is more commonly made with beef. I hope the Irish aren&#39;t offended! I&#39;ve made it with lamb and to be honest, I do prefer it with beef. Nothing speaks comfort like a good beef stew. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
