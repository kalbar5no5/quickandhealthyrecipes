Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
