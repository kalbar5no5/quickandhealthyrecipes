Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
