How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
