Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
