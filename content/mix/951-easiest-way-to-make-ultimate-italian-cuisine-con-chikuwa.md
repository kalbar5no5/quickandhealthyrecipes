Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
