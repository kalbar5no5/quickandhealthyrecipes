Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
