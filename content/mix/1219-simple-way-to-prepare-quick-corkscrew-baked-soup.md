A Good Corkscrew is an important item to have in your kitchen toolbox especially if you enjoy a glass of wine with your meals. The Reluctant Gourmet has been known to enjoy a sip or two while preparing a meal. So lucky for me, I was given the Cadillac of corkscrews for my birthday. Add the carrot, red pepper, onion and garlic. Run the chicken breasts through the dredge, shake to remove any excess flour, and place in the glass baking dish. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
