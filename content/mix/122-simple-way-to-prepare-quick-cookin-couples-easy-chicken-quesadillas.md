Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
