How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
