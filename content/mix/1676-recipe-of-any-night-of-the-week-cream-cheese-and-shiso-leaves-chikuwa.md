Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
