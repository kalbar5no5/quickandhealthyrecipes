Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
