Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
