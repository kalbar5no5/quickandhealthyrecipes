Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
