Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
