Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
