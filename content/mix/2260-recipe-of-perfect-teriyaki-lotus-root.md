Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
