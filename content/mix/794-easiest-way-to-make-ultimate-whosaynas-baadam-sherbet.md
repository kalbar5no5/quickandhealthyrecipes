How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
