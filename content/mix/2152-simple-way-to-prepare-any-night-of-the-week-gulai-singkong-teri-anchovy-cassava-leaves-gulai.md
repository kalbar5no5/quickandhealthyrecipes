How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
