Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
