Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
