A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
