Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
