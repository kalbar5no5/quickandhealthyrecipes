Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
