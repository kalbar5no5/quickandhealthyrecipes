How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
