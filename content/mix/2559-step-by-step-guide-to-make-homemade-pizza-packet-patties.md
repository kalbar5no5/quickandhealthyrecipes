Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
