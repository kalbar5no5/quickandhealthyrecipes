Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
