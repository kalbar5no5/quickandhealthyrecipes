Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
