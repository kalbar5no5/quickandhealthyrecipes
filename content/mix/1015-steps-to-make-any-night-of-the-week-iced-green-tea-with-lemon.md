Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
