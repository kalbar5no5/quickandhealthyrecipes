Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
