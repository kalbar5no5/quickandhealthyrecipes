Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
