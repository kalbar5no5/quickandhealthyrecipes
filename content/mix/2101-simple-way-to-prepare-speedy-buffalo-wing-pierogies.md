How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
