Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
