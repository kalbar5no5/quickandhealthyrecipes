Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
