Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
