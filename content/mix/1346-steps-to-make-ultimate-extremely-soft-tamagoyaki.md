Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
