Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
