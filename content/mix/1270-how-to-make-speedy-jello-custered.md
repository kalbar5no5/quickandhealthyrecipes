Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
