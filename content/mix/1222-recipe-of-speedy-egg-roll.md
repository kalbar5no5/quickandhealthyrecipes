Baking egg rolls definitely creates a different texture than frying, but I still liked them A LOT. I also experimented with freezing the egg rolls uncooked. After freezing I put them straight into a hot oven. These Chinese homemade egg rolls rival any restaurant! They are bursting with juicy pork, cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, and bean sprouts all wrapped up and fried OR BAKED to crispy perfection. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
