Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk.

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels.

Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
