Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
