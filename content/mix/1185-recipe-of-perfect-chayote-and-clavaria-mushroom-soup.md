Allow soup to cool and then puree in a blender until smooth. This chayote soup combination gives a good source of potassium, which helps to control blood pressure. The pear-looking chayote (佛手瓜) belongs to the gourd family. In the past, I used to pass by the chayote counter and gave it a blank stare because I don&#39;t know what to do with it. Now, I like to use it for soup. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
