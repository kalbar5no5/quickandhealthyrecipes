Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
