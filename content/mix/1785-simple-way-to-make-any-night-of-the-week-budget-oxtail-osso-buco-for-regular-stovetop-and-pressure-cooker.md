recipeingredient:
- "3 pounds welltrimmed of fat layer oxtail"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- " oil"
- "1 large carrot peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces"
- "1 large celery stalk cut into 1 12 inch pieces"
- "1 small onion peeled and chopped into 1 inch pieces"
- "4 whole large garlic cloves peeled and slightly crushed"
- "5 sprigs worth fresh thyme leaves or 15 teaspoons dried"
- "1 large bay leaf"
- "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried"
- "1 cup semidry or just not sweet wine white or red is fine"
- "1 1/2 cups unsalted stock beef or chicken"
- "1 1/2 Tablespoons tomato paste"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more if needed for seasoning"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season oxtails with the 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and dust all around with 1/4 cup all purpose flour."
- "Pressure cooker instructions:"
- "Saute the vegetables (carrot, celery, onion, garlic) in about 1 Tablespoon of oil over medium high heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until the onions begin to get translucent, and set aside. In the last minute of the second batch, toss the herbs in let them also bloom in the heat for about a minute."
- "Turn the heat down to just over medium, add another Tablespoon of oil, and sear the oxtails in two batches, about 3 minutes on each of 4 “sides” (they’re round, but you have to sear on roughly 4 sides), and until they have a nice, darker golden brown color to them and set aside. Add more oil to second batch if needed."
- "Turning the heat back to medium high, deglaze pot with the wine, making sure to scrape the bottom for any bits of fond (the caramelized bits of protein and sugar left on the pan from sauteing the veg and searing the meat) and let the wine come to a gentle boil for about 2 minutes before adding the stock, tomato paste, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Give it a couple of good stirs."
- "Layer the oxtail, vertically, in a single layer if possible, on the bottom of the pressure cooker, followed by the veg/herb mixture, and then pour in the liquid mixture."
- "Lock the lid, turn the heat up to high, and bring the pressure cooker to high pressure for about a minute before turning the heat down to medium and cooking for an additional 50 to 60 minutes. Adjust heat as needed to maintain a steady stream of steam escaping from the lid."
- "Remove pressure cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to come down on its own for about 15 minutes. Then check and adjust the seasoning. If it needs a little more salt and pepper or even sugar to balance out the acidity, add it in pinches, stir, and let sit for another 5 minutes before serving over risotto (traditional), pasta, or even plain steamed rice."
- "Regular stovetop instructions:"
- "If you’re making this stovetop in a 4 or 5 quart French or Dutch oven, increase the stock to 2.5 cups and the kosher salt to 1.5 Tablespoons, and replace Steps 7 and 8 with:"
- "Turn the heat up to high and bring the liquid to a rolling boil for about 2 minutes. Stir to redistribute the ingredients, place the lid slightly askew, reduce the heat to just under medium low, and simmer for another 2 ½ to 3 hours or so, or until the meat pulls away from the bone with very little effort."
- "Stir to redistribute every 20 to 30 minutes and to ensure that you don’t have the heat so high that you’re burning the sauce. The best way to tell is if you can scrape overcooked sauce solids off the cooking surface. If you can, adjust the heat down a bit, making sure to maintain a gentle simmer, and check in another 20 minutes to ensure that heat isn’t too high."
- "In the last 5 minutes of cooking, adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or even sugar to balance out acidity. Let cool for at least a good 15 minutes before serving over risotto (traditional), pasta, or even plain steamed rice."
- "Buon appetito!!! :)"

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
