Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
