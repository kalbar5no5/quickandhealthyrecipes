Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
