Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
