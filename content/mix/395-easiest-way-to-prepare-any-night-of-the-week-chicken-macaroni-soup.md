Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
