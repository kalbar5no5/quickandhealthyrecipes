How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
