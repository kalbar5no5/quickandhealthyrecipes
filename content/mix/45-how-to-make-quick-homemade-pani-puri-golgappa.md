How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
