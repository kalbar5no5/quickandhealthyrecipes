Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
