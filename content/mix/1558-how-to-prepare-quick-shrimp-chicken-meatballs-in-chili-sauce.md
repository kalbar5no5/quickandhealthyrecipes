I like Emeril&#39;s Pineapple Chicken Teriyaki meatballs for the recipe and I make the sauce on stove top, add the meatballs to crockpot and pour sauce over the meatballs &amp; cook for reasonable length of time/temp needed for the occasion. Star anise, ginger, soy sauce are all some of the aromatics that make up the broth. Along with those, I also use the shells from the shrimp for the meatballs. The shrimp shells add a wonderful and mild seafood taste in the broth that works perfectly with the spices.

You can also cook them completely in the fry pan. Adjust amount of Sweet Chili sauce and bread crumbs if it appears too dry or wet, but these amounts work perfectly for us. To make the meatballs: • Add the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, onion, milk, Worcestershire, and egg and mix these together in a large bowl, Next, add salt and pepper to this mixture. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
