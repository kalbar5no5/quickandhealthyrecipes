Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
