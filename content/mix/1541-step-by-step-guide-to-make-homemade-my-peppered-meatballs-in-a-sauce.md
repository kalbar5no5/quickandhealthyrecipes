Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
