Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
