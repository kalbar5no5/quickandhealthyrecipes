Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
