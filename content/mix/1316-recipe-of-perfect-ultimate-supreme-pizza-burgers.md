Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
