Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
