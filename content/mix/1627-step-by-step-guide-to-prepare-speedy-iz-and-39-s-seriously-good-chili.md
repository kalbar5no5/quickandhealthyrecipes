![Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/4505018127351808/751x532cq70/izs-seriously-good-chili-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, iz&#39;s seriously good chili. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

I cheat a bit with the seasoning. I have a local butcher that puts out some serious seasoned ground pork. It will still be great chili. But that corny flavor lends itself so well to beefy chili (why do you think we all love cornbread with our chili?) that I highly recommend adding it.

Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals in the world. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions every day. Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili is something which I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have iz&#39;s seriously good chili using 11 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili:

1. Get 1 medium onion, chopped
1. Take 1 lb ground chuck
1. Get 1 lb ground pork
1. Take 6 roma tomatoes, chopped
1. Make ready 1 can kidney beans 15oz
1. Get 1 can pinto beans 15oz

1. Prepare 1 can chopped green chilies 4oz
1. Make ready 1 can tomato sauce 8oz
1. Get 1 cup water
1. Prepare 1 chili powder


For our first time making chili we think its pretty damn good !! I have bad memories of my chili-eating college daysâ€”when chili was made by adding a can of beans and a can of tomatoes to ground beef, then adding one of every spice on the rack (and two of cumin), then simmering. The finished product inevitably had a totally unbalanced flavor, with a powdery, gritty mouthfeel from the dried spices. You can always add more veggies to this or even some spicy sausage or bacon, chili is great because you can truly make it your own.

##### Instructions to make Iz&#39;s Seriously Good Chili:

1. Place onion, pork, and beef into large heavy pot. I use my dutch oven. Brown on low heat. I don&#39;t drain, I am not looking for some low fat pansy stuff - I want chili!
1. Dice up the roma tomatoes and add them in. Cook tomatoes down a bit.
1. Put in beans and chilies. No...I don&#39;t rinse. Refer to step one for reason.
1. Add tomato sauce and water. If you like thick chili add less. Thinner? You can figure it out...
1. Finally the chili powder. First unscrew the lid, pull off that plastic piece with the holes and throw that in the trashcan. Next put some chili powder in. Don&#39;t be afraid of it, it&#39;s your friend. See picture for approximate amount.
1. Pop a beer and settle down. This needs to simmer for a while. 60 minutes minimum. Add water or beer to maintain desired thickness. Throw a lid on it if you prefer. Oh and this gives you plenty of time to get those grilled cheeses made.


The finished product inevitably had a totally unbalanced flavor, with a powdery, gritty mouthfeel from the dried spices. You can always add more veggies to this or even some spicy sausage or bacon, chili is great because you can truly make it your own. Serve with some shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream or even slices of avocado and enjoy! The ultimate chili should have a rich, complex flavor that combines sweet, bitter, hot, fresh, and fruity elements in balance, along with tender, creamy beans and chunks of beef bound together in a deep-red sauce. This bean-rich, ground beef chili will not only be delicious today, but it might even taste better tomorrow. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
