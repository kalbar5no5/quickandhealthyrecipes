Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
