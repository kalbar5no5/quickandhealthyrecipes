Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
