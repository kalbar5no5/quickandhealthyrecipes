Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
