Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
