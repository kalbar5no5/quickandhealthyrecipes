Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
