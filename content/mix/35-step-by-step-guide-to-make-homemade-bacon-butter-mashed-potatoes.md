Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!
