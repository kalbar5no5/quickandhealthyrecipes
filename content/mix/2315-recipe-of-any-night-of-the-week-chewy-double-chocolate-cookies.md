Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
