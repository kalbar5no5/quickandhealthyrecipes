How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
