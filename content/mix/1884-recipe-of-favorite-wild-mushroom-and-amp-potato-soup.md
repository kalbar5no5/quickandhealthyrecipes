Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
