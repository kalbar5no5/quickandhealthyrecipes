Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
