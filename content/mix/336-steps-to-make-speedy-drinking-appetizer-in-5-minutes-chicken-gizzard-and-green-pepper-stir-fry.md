Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
