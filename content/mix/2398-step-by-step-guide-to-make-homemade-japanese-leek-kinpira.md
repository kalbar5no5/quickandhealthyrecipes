Gobo (burdock) and carrots are sauteed and seasoned with mirin, soy and sesame oil. It has a sweet tangy flavor with crunchy, earthy texture. Despite its popularity in Japan, Kinpira Gobo is relatively unknown elsewhere. Crisp yet tender with bursts of sweet and savory flavors, Kinpira Renkon, or Japanese Lotus Root Stir Fry, is a classic home-cooked side dish. One of the reasons I love about Japanese home-cooked meals is that root vegetables are used in a whole range of dishes. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
