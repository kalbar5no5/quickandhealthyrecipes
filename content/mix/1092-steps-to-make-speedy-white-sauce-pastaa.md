Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
