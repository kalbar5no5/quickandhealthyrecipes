Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
