How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
