Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
