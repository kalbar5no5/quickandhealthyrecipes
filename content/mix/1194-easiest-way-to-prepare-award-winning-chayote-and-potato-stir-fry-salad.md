Besides stir-frying with pork, this is another new family favourite recipe added to the family dinner menu. Black fungus and carrots are added for both colour and nutrition, while my favourite vermicelli - the mung bean noodles (tang hoon) are added to soak up the sweet chicken and dried shrimps stock used to simmer the dish. Just add a little extra cook time to your soup or stir-fry to soften the skin. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
