Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
