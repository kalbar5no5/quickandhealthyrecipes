Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
