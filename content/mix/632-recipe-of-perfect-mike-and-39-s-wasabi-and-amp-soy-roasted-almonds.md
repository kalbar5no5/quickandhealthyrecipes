Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
