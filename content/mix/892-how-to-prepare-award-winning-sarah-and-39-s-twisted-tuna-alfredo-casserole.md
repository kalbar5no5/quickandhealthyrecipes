Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
