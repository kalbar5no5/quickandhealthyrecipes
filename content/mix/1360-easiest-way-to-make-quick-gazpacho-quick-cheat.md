I really enjoy gazpacho a lot. Sometime I make this soup on Sunday evening and then take it to school for lunch all week. The crunchy vegetables in the tomato base just add a healthy item to my menu.â€”Susan Ferrell, Tampa, Florida This quick and easy Gazpacho is for you. Spanish cookbooks classify Gazpacho as a salad. I&#39;m guessing that the Gazpacho over there is much chunkier than the Gazpacho over here. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
