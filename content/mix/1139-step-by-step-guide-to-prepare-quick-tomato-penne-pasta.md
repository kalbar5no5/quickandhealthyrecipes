Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
