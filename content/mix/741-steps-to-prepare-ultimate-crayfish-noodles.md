Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
