Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
