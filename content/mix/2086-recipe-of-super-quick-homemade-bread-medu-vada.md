Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
