Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
