Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
