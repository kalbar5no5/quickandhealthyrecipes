Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
