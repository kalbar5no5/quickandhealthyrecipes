Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
