Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
