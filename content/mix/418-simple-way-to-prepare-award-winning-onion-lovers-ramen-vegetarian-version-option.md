Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
