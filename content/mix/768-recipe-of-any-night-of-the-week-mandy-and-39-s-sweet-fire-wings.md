Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
