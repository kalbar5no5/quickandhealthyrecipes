Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
