Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
