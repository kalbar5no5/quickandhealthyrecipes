Cherry tomatoes stuffed with bacon crumbles, chopped romaine lettuce, cream cheese and mayo? These tomato cups are all the things you would find in a BLT sandwich, only in cute, bite-sized appetizer form. Plump cherry tomatoes (the T) are hollowed out then stuffed with a piece of arugula (the L) and crumbled bacon (the B). Some easy to make chipotle mayo is piped on top because you can&#39;t have a BLT (or mini BLT cups) without chipotle mayo. These BLT Bites take all the elements of a classic bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich and reduces them to one gorgeous, delicious bite. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
