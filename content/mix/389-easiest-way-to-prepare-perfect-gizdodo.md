Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
