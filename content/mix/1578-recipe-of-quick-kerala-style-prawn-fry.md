Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
