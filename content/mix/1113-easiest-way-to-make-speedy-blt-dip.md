Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
