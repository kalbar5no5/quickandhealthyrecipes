Every region of the country has their signature dish and Gumbo is the star of Louisiana. Cajun gumbo is the tomato-free version of this legendary Louisiana stew, though there are otherwise very few rules that govern what goes into the pot. In this recipe, we use the classic combo of chicken and andouille sausage, but feel free to change it up with other proteins. Begin by adding the oil to a large Dutch oven, or large enough pot to hold all these ingredients, factoring in the chicken stock.

In this recipe, we use the classic combo of chicken and andouille sausage, but feel free to change it up with other proteins. Begin by adding the oil to a large Dutch oven, or large enough pot to hold all these ingredients, factoring in the chicken stock. Once the oil is heated add in the chicken, and season with some salt and pepper. Most chicken gumbos these days are served with chicken that has been removed from the bone.

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
