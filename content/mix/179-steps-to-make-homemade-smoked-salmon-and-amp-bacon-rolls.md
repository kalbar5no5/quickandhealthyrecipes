Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
