Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
