Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
