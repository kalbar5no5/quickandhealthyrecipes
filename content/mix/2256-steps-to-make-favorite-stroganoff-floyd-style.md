Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
