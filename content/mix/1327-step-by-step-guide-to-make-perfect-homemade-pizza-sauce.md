Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
