How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
