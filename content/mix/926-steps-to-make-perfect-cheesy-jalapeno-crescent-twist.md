Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
