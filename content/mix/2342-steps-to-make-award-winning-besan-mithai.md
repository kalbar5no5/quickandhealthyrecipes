Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
