Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
