Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
