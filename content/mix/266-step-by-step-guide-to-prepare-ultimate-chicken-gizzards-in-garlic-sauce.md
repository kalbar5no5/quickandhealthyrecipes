Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
