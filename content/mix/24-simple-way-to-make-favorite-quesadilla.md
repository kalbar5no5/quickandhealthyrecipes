Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
