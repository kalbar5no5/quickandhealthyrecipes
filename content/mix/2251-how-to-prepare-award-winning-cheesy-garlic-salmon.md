Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
