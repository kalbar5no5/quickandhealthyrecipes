How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
