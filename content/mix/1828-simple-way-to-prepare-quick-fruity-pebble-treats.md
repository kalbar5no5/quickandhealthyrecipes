Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
