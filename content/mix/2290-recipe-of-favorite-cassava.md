Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!
