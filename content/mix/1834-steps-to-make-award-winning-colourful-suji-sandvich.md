Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
