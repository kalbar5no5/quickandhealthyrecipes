Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
