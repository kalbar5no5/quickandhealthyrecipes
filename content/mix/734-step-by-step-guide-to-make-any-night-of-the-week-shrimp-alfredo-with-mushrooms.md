Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
