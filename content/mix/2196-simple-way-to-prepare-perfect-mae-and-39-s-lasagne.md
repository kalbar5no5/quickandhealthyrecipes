Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
