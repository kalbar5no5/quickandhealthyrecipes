recipeinstructions:
- "De-thaw your pre-cooked Andouille Sausage in microwave and cut pieces at an angle 1&#34; long. Place in oversized pot."
- "Large chop all of your vegetables and put in your pot."
- "Open and drain your beans and place in pot. Reserve 1 can of Pinto Beans just in case you&#39;re one to enjoy a creamy texture in your Red Beans &amp; Rice or a thickener. Simply drain beans and smash with a potato masher and place in your oversized pot with your whole beans."
- "Add enough Beef Broth to accommodate your pot mixture. Not too much though. This dish should be viscous or a bit thicker upon serving [unless you&#39;re serving dipping bread] so you may not need both boxes."
- "Add all of your seasonings and a 1/2 of your extra large bottle of Tabasco. Stir and heat."
- "Bring your dish to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Stir intermittently."
- "Authors Note: While Crushed Tomatoes aren&#39;t indicative to this dish, we find they make an excellent accompaniment!"
- "Simmer until you think your veggies are well cooked. 2+ hours usually. Continue adding your Beef Broth throughout simmering if this dish becomes too thick."
- "In a separate pot, bring your Chicken Broth to a boil. Add Dried Chives and White Rice and cook as per the rice bag&#39;s directions. Chicken Broth lends a great flavor to bland rice. You can also use Uncle Bens Boil In Bag Rice. Just omit the Dried Chives and make sure to use Chicken Broth instead of water. You also have the option to place the rice directly in your oversized pot with all the other ingredients or on the side. I&#39;ll put the rice directly in my oversized pot if the dish is too thin. That step usually thickens this dish right up."
- "Pull out the Bay Leaves. Also, since the flavors of spices can dissipate with long simmer times, I taste test and add usually add 1/4 + more of my Tabasco bottle, Cajun Seasoning, Italian Seasoning, Garlic and Onion Powder. In general, I&#39;ll use 10 oz + of a large 12 oz bottle of Tabasco in this dish."
- "Simmer another 15 minutes and serve with dipping bread or corn bread and side bottles of Tabasco."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
