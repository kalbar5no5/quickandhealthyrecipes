Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
