Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
