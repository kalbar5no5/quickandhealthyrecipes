Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
