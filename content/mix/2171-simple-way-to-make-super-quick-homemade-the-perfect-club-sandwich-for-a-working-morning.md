Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, the perfect club sandwich for a working morning. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

For the last seven, eight, however many damn months we&#39;ve been working from home, the club sandwich remained something of a nice memory for me, something that was ordered on the road, always with the bacon omitted (unless they had turkey bacon on hand), and, if I was in Los Angeles, a slice of avocado replacing the middle piece of bread, like. Good sandwich bread, high-quality deli meat, fresh tomatoes, crisp lettuce, and excellent bacon are all critical to a truly good club sandwich. You don&#39;t really need a club sandwich recipe, so much as a guide on how to build the sandwich so that it&#39;s warm and crispy when you eat it. Toast the bread in a toaster, or under a broiler on both sides.

The perfect club sandwich for a working morning is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. The perfect club sandwich for a working morning is something that I've loved my entire life.

A classic club sandwich gets a vegetarian update with protein-packed hummus and flavorful pesto. Feel free to add some roasted chicken or turkey for bonus protein, too. Take out two slices of your favorite bread. Some of the most common types of bread are white, wheat, sourdough, multigrain, etcâ€¦ Pinwheel sandwiches are a great option to make ahead the morning of a celebration and refrigerate before guests arrive. These pinwheels are filled with cream cheese, ham, lettuce, fresh basil, and sundried tomatoes which provides chew as well as sweet and tangy flavor. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
