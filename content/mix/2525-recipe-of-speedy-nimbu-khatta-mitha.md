Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
