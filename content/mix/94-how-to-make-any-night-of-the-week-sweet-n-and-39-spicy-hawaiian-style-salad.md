Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
