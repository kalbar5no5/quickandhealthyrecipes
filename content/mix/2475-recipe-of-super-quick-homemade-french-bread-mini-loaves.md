Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
