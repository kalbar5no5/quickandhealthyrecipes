Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
