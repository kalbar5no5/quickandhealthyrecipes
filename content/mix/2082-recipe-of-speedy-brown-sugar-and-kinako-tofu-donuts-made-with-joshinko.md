Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
