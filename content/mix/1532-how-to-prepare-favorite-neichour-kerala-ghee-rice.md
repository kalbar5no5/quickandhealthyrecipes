Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
