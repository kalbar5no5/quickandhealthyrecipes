Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
