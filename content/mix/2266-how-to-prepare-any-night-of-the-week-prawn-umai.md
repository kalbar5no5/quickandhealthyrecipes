Typically, raw fish or raw prawn is used. - Malaysian (Sarawak) Cuisine Borneo Prawn Umai (Lime-Marinated Prawn Salad) You may also like.

The ingredient shall still be the same, except that I have noted that I need to use more lime juice compare to the Fish Umai in order for it to be cooked thoroughly and safe for consumption. As usual, use the freshest seafood that you can find. Traditionally, umai is thinly sliced raw fish manirated with &#34;assam payak&#34;, a very sour fruit of a wild palm, onions, chillies, and a pinch of salt.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
