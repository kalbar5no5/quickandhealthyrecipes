How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
