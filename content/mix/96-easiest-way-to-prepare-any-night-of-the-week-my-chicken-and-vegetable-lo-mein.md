Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
