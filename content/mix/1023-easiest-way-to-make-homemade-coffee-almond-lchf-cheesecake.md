Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
