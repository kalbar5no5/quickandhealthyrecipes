Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
