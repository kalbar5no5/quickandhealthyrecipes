Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
