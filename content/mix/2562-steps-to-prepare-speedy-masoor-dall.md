Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
