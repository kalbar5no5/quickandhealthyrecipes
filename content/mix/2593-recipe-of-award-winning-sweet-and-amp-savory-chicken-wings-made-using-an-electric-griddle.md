How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
