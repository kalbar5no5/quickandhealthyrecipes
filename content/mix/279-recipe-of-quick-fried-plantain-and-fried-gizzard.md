Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
