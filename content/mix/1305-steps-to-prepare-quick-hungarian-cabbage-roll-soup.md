How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
