Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
