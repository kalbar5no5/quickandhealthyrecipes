Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
