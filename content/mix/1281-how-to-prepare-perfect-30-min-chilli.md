We think it is best enjoyed with a grilled cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top. Remove casings from sausage, and discard; brown sausage and ground beef together as directed. Start with things you might already have in the cupboard—diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and onion—to create a knock-out meal with minimal prep. Crumble the beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat.

30 min chilli is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. 30 min chilli is something that I have loved my whole life.

Loaded with vegetables, ground beef, spices and beans, this easy chili is the ultimate comfort food. Simple, old-fashioned chili at its best. Just like I do in my Chicken Enchilada Soup. It gives the dish such a deep and rich flavor that you just couldn&#39;t get without it. Bring just to boiling over medium-high; reduce heat. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
