Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
