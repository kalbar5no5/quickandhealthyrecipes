Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
