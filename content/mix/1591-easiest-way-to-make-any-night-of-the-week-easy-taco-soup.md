This easy soup is hearty, yet extremely tasty. This is really a form of chili, but uses some ingredients not found in regular chili. Sure to be a hit, you can adjust the spice as needed by using varying levels of jalapenos and RO*TELÂ® varieties. Top with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and/or sour cream. Whether you make your taco soup on the stovetop or in the slow cooker, the process is basically the same: start by browning the ground beef and onion in a pot. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
