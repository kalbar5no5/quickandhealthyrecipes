Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
