Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
