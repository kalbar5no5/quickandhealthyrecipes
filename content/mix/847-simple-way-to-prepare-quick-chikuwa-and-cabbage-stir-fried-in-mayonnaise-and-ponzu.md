Heat Oil in a frying pan, stir-fry Chikura over medium heat until slightly browned, and it won&#39;t take long. Then, add Sugar and Soy sauce, and stir-fry until sauce is gone and slightly caramelised. Sprinkle with some Aonori (Dried Green Laver Flakes) and Toasted Sesame Seeds. Add the cabbage, wine, soy sauce, sugar, and water. Uncover the lid, and stir in the black vinegar, scallions, and salt to taste. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
