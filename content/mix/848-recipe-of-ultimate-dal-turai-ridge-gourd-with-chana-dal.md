Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
