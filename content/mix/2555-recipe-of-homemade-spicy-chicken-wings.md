Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body.
