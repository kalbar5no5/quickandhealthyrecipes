Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
