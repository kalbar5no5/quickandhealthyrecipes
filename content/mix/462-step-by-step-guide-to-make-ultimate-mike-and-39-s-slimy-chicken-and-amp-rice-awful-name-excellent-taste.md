Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
