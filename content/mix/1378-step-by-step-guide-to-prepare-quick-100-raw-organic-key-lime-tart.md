Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
