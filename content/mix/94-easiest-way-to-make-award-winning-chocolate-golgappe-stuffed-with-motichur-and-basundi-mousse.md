Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
