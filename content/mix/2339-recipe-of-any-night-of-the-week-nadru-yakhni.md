Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
