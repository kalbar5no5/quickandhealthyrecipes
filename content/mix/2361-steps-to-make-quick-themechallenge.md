How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
