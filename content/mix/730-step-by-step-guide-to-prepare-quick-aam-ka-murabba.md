Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
