Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
