Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
