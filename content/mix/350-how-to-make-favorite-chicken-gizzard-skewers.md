Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
