Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
