Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
