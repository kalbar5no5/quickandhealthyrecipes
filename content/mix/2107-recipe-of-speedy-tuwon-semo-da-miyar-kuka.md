Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
