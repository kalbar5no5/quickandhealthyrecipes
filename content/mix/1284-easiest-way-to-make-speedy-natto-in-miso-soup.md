Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
