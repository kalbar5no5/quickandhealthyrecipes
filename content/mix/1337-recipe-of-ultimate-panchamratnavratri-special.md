Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
