Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
