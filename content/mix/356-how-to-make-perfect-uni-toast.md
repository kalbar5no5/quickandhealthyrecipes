Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
