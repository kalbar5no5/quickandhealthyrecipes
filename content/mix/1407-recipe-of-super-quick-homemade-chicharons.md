Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
