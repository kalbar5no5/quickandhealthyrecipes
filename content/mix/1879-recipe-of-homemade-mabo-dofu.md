Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
