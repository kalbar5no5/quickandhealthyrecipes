Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
