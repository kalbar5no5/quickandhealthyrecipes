Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
