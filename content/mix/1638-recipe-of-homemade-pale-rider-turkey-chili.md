Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
