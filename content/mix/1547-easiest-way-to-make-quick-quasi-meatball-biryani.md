Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
