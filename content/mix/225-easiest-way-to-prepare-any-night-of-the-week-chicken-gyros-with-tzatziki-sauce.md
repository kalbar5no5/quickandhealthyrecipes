Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
