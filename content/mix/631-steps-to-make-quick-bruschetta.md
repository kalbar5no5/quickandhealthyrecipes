Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
