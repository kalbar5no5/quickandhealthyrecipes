Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
