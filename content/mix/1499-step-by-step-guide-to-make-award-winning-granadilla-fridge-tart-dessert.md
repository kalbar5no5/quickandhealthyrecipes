Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
