Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
