Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
