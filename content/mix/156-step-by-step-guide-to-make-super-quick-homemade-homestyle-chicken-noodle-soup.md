Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
