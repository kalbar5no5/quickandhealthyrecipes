There is no bitter after taste of the matcha. It goes well with fresh fruits like strawberry and blueberry. However the lava is not as runny as expected. They have matcha and chocolate varieties - matcha is green tea powder (wow!) and their best seller is the chocolate lava cake. We actually did return on another day just to try their green tea lava cake. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
