Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
