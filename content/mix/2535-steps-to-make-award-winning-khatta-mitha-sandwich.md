Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood.

Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine.
