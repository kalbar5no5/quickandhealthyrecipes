Easy and much better than Indian restaurants. Transfer the Chicken Tikka Masala to a serving platter and garnish with the chopped cilantro leaves before serving. For this chicken tikka masala recipe, the yogurt helps tenderize the chicken; the garlic, ginger, and spices in the marinade infuse it with lots of flavor. It doesn&#39;t taste much like Chicken Tikka Masala to me â€” the addition of the tinned tomatoes just makes it waaay too, well, tomatoey. Thread chicken on skewers, and marinate (in the refrigerator) for an hour or so. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
