Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
