Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
