The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood.

They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
