Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
