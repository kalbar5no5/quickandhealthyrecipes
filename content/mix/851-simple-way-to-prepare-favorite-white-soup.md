Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
