How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
