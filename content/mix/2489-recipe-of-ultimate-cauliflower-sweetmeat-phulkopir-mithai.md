Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
