Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
