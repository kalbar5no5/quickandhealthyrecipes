Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
