How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
