Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
