Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
