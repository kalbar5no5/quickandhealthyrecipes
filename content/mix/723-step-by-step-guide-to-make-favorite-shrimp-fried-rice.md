Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
