Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
