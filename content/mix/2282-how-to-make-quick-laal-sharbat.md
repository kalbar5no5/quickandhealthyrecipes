Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
