Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
