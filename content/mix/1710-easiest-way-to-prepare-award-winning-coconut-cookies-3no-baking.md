Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
