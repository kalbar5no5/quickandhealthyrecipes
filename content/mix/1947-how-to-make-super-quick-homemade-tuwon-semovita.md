How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
