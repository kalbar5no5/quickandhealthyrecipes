Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
