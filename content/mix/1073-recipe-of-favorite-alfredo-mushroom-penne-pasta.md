Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
