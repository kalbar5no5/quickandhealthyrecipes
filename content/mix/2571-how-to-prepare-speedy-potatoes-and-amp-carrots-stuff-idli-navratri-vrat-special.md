Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
