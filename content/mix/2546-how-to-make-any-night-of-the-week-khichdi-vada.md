Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
