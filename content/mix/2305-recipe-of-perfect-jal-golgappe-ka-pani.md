Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
