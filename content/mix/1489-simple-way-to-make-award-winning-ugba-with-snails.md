Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
