Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
