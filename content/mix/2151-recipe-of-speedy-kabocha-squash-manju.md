Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
