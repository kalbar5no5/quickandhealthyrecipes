Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
