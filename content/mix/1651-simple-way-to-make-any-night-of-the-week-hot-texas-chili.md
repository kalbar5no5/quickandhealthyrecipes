recipeingredient:
- "1/2 lb small dry red beans"
- "1/2 lb dry black beans"
- "1/2 lb dry pinto beans"
- "1/2 lb dry kidney beans"
- "1 medium white onion chunked"
- "2 jalapeos sliced"
- "5 clove garlic"
- "3 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1 can diced tomatoes"
- "1 lb lean ground beef"
- "1 seasoned salt"
- "1 chili powder"
- "1 cumin"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large stock pot halfway with water. Add all the dry beans. Bring to a hard boil and let the beans boil as hard as you can for 10 minutes."
- "Strain the beans in a colander, then rinse them with tap water. Transfer them to a large bowl and cover them in cold water. Let them sit for a while. Meanwhile..."
- "Clean the stock pot out (it will have a ring of gross bean starch stuff in it), and return it to the stove. While on medium heat, add the onion, jalepeno, garlic, and vegetable oil. (A note on jalepenos: if you leave the stems and membranes in, you get spicy chili. Chop them out if you need something milder.)"
- "Stir the veggies so they get coated in oil. Cook them for about 10-15 minutes. This smells amazing!"
- "Pour in the can of diced tomatoes. Add the seasoned salt, chili powder, and cumin. How much? Use your best judgment, but understand that you need to use more than you need to season this mixture because you&#39;ll be adding lots of water later, which dilutes the flavor. Start with a couple tablespoons of each and see where that takes you."
- "Stew the veggies in the pot for about 10 more minutes."
- "Add the ground beef. As it cooks, stir it with a wooden spoon, and break up the beef."
- "While the beef is browning, drain the beans of their water, which will be dirty again. Add them back to the stock pot."
- "Add enough water to cover the beans fully, but just so. Adding too much water makes for runny chili."
- "Simmer covered over low-medium heat for about two hours, stirring frequently. Test the beans once in a while, and if the water level drops below the beans, add a little bit more water."
- "When the beans are soft, taste test the chili. Add more spices to taste. If you have to add spices, give it a good stir and let it simmer for a few more minutes, then taste again."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
