Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
