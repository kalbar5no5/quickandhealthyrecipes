Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood.
