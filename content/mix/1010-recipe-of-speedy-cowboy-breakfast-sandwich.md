Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
