Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
