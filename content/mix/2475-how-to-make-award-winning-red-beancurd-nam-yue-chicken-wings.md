Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
