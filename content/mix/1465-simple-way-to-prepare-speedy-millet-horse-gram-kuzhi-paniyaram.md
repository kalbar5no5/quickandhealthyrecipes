Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
