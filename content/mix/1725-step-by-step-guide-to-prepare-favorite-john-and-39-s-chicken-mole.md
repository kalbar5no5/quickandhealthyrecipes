Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
