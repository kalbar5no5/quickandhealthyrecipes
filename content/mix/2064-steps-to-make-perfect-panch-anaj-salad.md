Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
