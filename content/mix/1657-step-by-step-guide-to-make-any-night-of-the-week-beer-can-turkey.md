Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
