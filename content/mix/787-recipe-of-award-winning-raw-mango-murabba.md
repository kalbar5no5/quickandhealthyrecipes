Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
