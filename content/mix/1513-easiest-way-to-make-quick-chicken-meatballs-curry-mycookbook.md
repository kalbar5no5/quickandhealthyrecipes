Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
