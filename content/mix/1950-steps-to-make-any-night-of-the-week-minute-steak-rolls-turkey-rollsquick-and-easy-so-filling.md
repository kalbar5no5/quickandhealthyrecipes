Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
