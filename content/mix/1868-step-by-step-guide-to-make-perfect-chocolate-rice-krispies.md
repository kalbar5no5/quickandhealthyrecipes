How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
