Karri (â€‹Eucalyptus diversicolor) is a beautiful, tall forest giant found in the Warren region near the southern coast of Western Australia (WA). The Warren region was named after the Warren River and created to encompass the karri forest although a few remnant populations exist just outside the region. Karri was the first born child of Dick Peterson &amp; Carole Nichelin. Karri has helped thousands of schools and other community organisations collect funds from parents and members, and has removed hundreds of millions of Rands from school campuses across the country.

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
