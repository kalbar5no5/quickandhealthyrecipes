Paneer is a type of fresh cheese, meaning you can make it and eat it right away — no aging or culturing required. It&#39;s also one of the easiest cheeses to make at home. All you need is milk, lemon juice or vinegar, and a bit of salt to season. Add the lemon juice and begin stirring the milk. The milk will begin to curdle and the cheesy lumps will begin to sink to the bottom of the pan. 

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
