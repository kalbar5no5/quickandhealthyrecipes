Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
