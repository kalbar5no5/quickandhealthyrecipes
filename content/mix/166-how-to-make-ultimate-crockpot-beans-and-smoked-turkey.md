Both my husband &amp; I really love Lima Beans, &amp; I decided to make some for dinner on Sunday. I thought the Smoked Turkey would add just the right amount of flavor to them &amp; they turned out great. I added a few extra spices to enhance the flavor, &amp; they turned out just wonderful. As a kid in Arkansas we always had sliced tomatoes, onions &amp; cucumbers in vinegar with them with just a hint of sugar.

I added a few extra spices to enhance the flavor, &amp; they turned out just wonderful. As a kid in Arkansas we always had sliced tomatoes, onions &amp; cucumbers in vinegar with them with just a hint of sugar. Add thyme, bay leaves, cayenne, stock, smoked turkey, and beans. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce to a bare simmer. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
