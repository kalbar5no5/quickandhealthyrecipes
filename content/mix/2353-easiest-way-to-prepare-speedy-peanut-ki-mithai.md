Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
