How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
