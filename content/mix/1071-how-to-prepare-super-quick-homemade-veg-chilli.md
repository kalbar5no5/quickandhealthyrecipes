Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
