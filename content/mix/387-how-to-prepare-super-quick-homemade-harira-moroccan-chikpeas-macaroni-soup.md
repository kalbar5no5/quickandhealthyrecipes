Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
