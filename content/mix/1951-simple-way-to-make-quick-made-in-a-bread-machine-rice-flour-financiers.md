Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
