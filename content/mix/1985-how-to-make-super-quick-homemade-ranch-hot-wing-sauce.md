How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
