Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
