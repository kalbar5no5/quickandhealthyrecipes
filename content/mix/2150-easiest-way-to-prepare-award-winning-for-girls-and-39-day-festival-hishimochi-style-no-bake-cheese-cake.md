Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
