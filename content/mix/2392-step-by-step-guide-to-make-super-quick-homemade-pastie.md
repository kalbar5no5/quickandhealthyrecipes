Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
