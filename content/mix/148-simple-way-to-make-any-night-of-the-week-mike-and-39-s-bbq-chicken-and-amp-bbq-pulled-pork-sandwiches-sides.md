All the meats are smoked before grinding to give our stew a rich aroma and deep flavor that just has to be experienced. Choose from our delicious baby back ribs, smoked chicken (half or whole), smoked chicken wings, beef brisket or pulled meat sandwiches, and unforgettable sides like our corn muffins, cole slaw, and BBQ beans.

Mike grew up on the North Shore in Haleiwa, Hawaii. The coastline was overgrown with Kiawe trees. Mike&#39;s Huli chicken is broiled over Kiawe wood and naturally flavored with traditional Hawaiian sea salt. Kiawe wood gives the chicken it&#39;s unique smoked flavor. &#34;Maui Mike&#39;s&#34; and &#34;Maui Wowie&#34; are trademarks owned by Maui Mike&#39;s Inc. Fresh premium chicken that&#39;s hand-massaged with our special seasoning then fire-roasted for hours to perfection. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
