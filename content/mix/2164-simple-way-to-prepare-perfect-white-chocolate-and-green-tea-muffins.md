How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
