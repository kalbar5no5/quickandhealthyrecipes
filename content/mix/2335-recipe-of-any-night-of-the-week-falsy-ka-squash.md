Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
