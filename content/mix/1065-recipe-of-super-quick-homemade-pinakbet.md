Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
