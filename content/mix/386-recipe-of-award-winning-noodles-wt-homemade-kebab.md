Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
