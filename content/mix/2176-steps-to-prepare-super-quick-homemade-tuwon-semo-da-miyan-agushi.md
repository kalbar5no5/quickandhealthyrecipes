Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
