How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
