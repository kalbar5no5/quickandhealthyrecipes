Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
