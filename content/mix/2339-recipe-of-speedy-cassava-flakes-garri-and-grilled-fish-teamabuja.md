Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
