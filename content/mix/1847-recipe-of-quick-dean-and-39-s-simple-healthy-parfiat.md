How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
