Minced garlic is usually mashed in the mofongo with chicharrónes, but since the shrimp sauce is very garlicky; I prefer no additional garlic. If shrimp sauce is too thick for preference, you may add a little bit of water. It is best served while mofongo is still hot. Mofongo Recipe - unripe fried and mashed plantains infused with garlic, and chicharrones (fried pork skin) then assembled and stuffed with a succulent tomato, garlic, onion, shrimp sauce. What I love about food blogging is that I get to recreate recipes from my favorite restaurants. 

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
