In a bowl, combine the chicken, cracker crumbs, mayonnaise, onions, lemon juice and pepper. All you need is a rotisserie chicken or cooked chicken meat, a simple batter, mozzarella cheese, and Panko bread crumbs (or use whatever bread crumbs you have on hand). The lemon zest and dill seem insignificant, but they completely transform these chicken patties. Add veggies to raw chicken and mix thoroughly.

About once a week, I take out a large baking sheet and bake lots of chicken breasts. Chicken Patties, succulent little morsels of chicken, bread crumbs, and seasonings are FUN to dip in homemade Tzatziki or BBQ sauce or Honey Mustard. Chicken Patties are FUN to cram into pita bread sandwiches. Top with spaghetti sauce and cheeses.

Chicken Patties are FUN to cram into pita bread sandwiches. Top with spaghetti sauce and cheeses. Breadcrumbs soak up the natural juice in the ground chicken, making the patty dry with a grainy texture. DO NOT coat the patties with breadcrumbs, too. Shallow fry the patties on a skillet with just a little bit of cooking oil. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
