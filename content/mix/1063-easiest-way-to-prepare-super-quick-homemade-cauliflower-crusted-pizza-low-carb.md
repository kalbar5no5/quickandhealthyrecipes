Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
