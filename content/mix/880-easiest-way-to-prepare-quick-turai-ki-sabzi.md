Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
