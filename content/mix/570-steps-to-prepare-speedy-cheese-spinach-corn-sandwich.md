Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
