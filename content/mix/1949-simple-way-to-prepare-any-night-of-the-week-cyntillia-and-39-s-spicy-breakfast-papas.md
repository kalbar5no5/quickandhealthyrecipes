Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
