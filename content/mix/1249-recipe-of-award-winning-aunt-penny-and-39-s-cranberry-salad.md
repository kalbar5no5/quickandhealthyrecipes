Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
