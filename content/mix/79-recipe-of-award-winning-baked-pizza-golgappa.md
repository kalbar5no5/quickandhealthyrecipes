How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
