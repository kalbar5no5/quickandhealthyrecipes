Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
