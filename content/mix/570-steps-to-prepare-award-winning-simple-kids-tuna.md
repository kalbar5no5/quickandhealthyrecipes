Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
