Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
