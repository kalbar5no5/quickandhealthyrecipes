Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
