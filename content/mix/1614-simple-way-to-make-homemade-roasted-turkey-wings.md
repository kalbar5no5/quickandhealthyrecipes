Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
