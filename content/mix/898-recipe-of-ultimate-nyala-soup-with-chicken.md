Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
