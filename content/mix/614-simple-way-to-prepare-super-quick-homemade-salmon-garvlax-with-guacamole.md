Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
