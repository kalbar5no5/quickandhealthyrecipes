Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
