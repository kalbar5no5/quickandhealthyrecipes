Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
