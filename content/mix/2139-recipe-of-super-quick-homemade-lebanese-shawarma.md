Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
