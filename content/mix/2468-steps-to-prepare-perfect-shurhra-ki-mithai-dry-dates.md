Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
