Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
