How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
