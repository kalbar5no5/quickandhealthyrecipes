Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
