Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
