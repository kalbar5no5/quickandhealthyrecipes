Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
