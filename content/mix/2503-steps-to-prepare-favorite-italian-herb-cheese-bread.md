Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
