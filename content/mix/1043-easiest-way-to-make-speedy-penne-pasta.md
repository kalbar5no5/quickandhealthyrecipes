Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
