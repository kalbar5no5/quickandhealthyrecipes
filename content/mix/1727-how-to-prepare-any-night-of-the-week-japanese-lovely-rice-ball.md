Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
