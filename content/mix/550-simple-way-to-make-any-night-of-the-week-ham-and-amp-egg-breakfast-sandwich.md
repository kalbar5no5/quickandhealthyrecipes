Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
