Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
