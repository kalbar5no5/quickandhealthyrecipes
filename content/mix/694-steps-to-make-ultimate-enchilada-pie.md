Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
