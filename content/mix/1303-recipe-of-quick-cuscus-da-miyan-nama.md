Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
