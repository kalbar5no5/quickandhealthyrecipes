Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
