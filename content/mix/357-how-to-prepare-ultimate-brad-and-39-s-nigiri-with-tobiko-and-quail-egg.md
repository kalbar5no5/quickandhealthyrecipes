How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
