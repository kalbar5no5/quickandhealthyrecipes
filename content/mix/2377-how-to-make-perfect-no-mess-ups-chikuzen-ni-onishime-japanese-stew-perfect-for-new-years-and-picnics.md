Simmered in a savory dashi based sauce, Nishime is a classic one-pot vegetable stew to serve in Osechi for the Japanese New Year celebration.

Today&#39;s Cream Stew tastes like the stew made from the store-bought House Cream Stew roux. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
