Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
