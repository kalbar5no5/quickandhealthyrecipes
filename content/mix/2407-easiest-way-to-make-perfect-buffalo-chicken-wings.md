Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
