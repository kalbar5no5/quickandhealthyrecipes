These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful!
