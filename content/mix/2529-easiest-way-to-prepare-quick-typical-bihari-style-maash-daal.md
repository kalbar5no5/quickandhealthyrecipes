Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
