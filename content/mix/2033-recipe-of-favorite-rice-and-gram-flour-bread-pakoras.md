Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
