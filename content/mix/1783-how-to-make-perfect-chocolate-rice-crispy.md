Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
