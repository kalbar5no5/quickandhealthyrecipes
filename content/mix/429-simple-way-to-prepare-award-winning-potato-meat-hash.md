Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
