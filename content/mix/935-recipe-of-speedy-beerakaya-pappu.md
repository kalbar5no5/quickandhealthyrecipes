Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!
