Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
