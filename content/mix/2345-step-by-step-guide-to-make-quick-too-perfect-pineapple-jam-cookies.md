Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
