Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
