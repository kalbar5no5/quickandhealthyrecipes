Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
