Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
