Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
