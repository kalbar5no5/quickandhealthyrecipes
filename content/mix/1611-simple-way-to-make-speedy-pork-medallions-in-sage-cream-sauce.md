Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
