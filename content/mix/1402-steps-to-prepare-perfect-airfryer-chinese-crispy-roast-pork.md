Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
