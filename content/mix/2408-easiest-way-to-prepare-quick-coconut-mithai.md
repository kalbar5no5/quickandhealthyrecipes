How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
