How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
