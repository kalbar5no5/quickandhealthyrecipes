Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
