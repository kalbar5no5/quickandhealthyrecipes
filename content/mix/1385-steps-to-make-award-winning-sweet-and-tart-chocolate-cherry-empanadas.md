This recipe for easy pastry dough for dessert empanadas or sweet turnovers/hand pies is very similar to a pastry dough that you would use for sweet tarts or pies.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
