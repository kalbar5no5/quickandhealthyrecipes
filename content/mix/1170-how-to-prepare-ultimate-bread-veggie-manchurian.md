Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
