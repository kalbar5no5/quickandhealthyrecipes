Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
