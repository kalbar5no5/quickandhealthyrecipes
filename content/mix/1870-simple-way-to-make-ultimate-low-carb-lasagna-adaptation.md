recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Peel and slice the Squash into thin, Lasagna like slices. The original recipe suggested using a Mandolin to keep the slices of uniform thickness, but I&#39;d recommend just slicing it as close to uniform as possible. Place the squash slices in an 8 oz square microwave safe glass baking dish, and microwave the squash slices for 4 minutes, covered with Saran Wrap. Remove the squash slices, and spray the glass dish with Cooking Spray."
- "Roughly dice the red onion, and saute it with the garlic for about 4 minutes. Clean the spinach leaves, and wilt them in the pan with the onions and garlic."
- "Get your blender out, and put yogurt, milk, and 1 Package of Kraft Creamy Melt cheese in the blender. Blend the mixture for 20 seconds. Add flour, salt, and eggs, then blend for another minute."
- "Pour 1/2 Cup of the yogurt/milk sauce into the square glass baking pan. Place a layer of the microwaved Butternut Squash atop the yogurt/milk sauce in the baking pan. Layer the onion/garlic/wilted spinach mixture, Gruyere Cheese, and the remaining package of Kraft Creamy Melt Italian cheese, for 2-3 layers if possible. Pour the remaining yogurt mixture over the top of the layers, top it with more Gruyere, and sprinkle Italian Spice Mix on top of the cheese."
- "Bake the mixture for 50 Minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and start the broiler. Broil the Lasagna for 4 more minutes to crisp the top. Let it rest for 15 minutes, and it should be ready to serve."

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
