Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
