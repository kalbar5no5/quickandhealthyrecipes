I am sharing my absolute favorite way to make the best Punjabi Kadhi Pakora at home. As far as I can remember, I have always been a kadhi fan. Punjabi Kadhi is a soupy curry with lots of pakoras in it, and is finished off with a karhi patta tadka. To get the best taste, pakora should simmer in kadhi for some time, So it soaks up some gravy and flavors, will become soft.

Punjabi Kadhi is a soupy curry with lots of pakoras in it, and is finished off with a karhi patta tadka. To get the best taste, pakora should simmer in kadhi for some time, So it soaks up some gravy and flavors, will become soft. Punjabi kadhi is a quite popular curry recipe made out of beaten curd or yogurt which is the best option to include in our daily meals during summers. Kadhi can be made in several forms and today I have made it in a punjabi style with slight variations here and there. Sift the chickpea flour into a medium bowl. 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
