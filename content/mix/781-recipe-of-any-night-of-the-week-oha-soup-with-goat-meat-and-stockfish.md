Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
