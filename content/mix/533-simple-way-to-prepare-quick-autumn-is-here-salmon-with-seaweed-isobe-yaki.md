Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
