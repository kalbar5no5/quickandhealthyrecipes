It originates from the Middle East and is often served with pita bread, olives, or vegetables as a flavorful appetizer. It&#39;s one of my personal favorite recipes. Baba ganoush is best after the flavors have had time to meld together. I recommend refrigerating for at least an hour before serving, for the best flavor. But if you&#39;d like to prep this ahead of time, you can freeze the eggplant flesh for a few months. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
