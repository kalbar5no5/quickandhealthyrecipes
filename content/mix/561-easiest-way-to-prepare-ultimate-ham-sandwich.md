If you ever find yourself in a pinch for a good meal, ham, cheese, and bread are there for you. Just because ham sandwiches are simple and ever-so reliable doesn&#39;t mean you have to stop at a bare-bones recipe, though. Switching up your cheese, spreading on some jam or even (well, especially) adding a little heat will take your humble ham sandwich to an incredible new level.

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
