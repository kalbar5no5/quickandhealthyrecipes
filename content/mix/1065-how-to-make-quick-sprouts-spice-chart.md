Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
