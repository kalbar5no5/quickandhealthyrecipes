Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
