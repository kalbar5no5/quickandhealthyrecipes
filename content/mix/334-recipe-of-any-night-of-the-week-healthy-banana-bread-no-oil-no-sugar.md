Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
