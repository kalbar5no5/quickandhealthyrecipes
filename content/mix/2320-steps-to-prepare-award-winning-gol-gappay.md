Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
