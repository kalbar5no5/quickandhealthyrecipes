Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
