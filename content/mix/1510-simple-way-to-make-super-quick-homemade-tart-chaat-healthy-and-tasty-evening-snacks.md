Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
