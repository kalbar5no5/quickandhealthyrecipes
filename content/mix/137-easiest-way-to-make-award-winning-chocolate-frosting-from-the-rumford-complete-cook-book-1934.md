Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
