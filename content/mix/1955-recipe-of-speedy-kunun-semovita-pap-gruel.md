Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
