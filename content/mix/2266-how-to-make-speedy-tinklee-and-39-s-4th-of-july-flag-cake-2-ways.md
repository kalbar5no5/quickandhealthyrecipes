Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
