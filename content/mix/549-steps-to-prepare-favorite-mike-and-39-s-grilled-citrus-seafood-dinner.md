Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
