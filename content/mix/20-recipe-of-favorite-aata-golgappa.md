Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
