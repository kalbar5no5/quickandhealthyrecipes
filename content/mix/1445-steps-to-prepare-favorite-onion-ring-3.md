Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
