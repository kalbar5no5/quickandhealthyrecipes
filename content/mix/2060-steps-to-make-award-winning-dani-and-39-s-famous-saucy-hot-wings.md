Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
