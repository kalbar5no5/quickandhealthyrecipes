Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
