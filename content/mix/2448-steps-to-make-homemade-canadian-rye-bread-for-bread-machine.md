Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
