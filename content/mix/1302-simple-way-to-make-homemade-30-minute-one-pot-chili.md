Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
