Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
