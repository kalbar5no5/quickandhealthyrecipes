In a large zippy bag, place flour and salt and pepper. The Gizzards need to be boiled with MSG or some other meat tenderizer and also I use chicken boullion and garlic powder to boil them in. Gives them the extra flavour that the plain water removes. The other trick to keeping the batter on is to make sure the gizzards are completely cooled (run under very cold water until cool) and YES I also dip. I make chicken gizzards and hearts all the time, and this recipe was simple but not alot of flavor. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
