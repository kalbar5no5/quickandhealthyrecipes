Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
