How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
