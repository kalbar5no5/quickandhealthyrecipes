Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
