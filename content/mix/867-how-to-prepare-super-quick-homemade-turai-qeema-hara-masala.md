Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
