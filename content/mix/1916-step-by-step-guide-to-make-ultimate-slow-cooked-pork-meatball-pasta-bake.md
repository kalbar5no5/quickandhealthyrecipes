Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
