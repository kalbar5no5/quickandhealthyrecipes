Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
