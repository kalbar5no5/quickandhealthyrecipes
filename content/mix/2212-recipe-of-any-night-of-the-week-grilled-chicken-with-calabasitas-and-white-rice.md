Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
