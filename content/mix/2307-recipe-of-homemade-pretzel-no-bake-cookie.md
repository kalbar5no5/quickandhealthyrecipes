Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
