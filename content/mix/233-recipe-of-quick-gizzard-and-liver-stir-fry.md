Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
