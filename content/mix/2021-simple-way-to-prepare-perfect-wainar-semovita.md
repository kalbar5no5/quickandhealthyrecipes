Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
