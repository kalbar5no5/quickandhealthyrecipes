Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
