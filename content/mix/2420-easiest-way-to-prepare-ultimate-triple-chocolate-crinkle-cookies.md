Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
