Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
