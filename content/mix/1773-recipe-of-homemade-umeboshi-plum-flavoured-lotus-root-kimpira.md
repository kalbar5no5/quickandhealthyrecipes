Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
