Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
