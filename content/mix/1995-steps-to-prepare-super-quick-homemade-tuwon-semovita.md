Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
