Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
