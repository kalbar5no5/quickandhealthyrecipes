Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
