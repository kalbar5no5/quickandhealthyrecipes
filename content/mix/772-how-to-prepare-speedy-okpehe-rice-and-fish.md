How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
