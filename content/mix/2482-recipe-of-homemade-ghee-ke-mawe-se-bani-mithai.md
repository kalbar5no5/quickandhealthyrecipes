Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
