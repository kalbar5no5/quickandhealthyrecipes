Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
