How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
