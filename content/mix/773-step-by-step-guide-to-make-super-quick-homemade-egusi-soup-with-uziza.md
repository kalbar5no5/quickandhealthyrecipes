How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
