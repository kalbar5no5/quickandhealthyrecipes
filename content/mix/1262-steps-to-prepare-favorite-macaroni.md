Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
