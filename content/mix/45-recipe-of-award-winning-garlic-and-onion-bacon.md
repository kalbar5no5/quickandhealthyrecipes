Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
