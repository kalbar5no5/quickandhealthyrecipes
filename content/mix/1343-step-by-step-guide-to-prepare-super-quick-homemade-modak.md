Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
