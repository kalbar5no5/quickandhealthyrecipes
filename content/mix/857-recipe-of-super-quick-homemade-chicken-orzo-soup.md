Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
