Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
