How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
