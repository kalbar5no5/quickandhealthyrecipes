Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
