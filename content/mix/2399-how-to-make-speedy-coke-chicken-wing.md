Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
