Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
