How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
