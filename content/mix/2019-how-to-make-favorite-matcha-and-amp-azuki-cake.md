Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
