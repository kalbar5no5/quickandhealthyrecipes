Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
