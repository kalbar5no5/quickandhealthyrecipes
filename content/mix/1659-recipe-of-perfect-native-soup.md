Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
