Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
