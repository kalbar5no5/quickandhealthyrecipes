Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
