Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
