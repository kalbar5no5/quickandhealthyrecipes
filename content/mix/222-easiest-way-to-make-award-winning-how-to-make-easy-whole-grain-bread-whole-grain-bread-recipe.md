How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
