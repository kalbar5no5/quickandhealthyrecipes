Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
