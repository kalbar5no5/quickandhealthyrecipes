How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
