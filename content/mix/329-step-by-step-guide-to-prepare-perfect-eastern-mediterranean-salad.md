Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
