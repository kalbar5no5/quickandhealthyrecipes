Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
