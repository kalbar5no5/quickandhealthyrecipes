Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
