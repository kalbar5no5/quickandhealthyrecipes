Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
