Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
