Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
