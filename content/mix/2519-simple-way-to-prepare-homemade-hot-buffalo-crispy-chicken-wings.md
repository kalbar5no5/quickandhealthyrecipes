Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
