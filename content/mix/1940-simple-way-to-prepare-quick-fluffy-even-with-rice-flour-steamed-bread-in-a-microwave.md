Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
