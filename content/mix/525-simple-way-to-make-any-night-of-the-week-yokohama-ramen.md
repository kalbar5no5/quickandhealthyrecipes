But iekei ramen is something new for most, unless you happen to hail from Yokohama or miss the port city&#39;s many delicacies as much as I do. Since then, it has become a bit of a Yokohama treasure (along with the aforementioned Cup Noodle Museum). We make our noodles fresh in-house for a flavor and texture you won&#39;t find anywhere else this side of the Pacific. Our broths are thick and hearty, and our flavors bold.

We make our noodles fresh in-house for a flavor and texture you won&#39;t find anywhere else this side of the Pacific. Our broths are thick and hearty, and our flavors bold. The Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum was the world&#39;s first food-themed amusement park. Come here to sample and learn about the famous noodle soup created in China and perfected in Japan by trying ramen from across the country, housed in a picture-perfect recreation of post-War Japan&#39;s streets. On a recent afternoon, diners at its new premises in the bowels of the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum barely looked up as they demolished servings of noodles made according to the restaurant&#39;s original. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
