Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
