Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
