recipeinstructions:
- "Season the eggplant slices on both sides with salt. Cover with a paper towel to soak up the moisture. Set aside for about 20 minutes."
- "Heat a large sauce pan over medium-high heat with a small amount of olive oil. Add the beef and the spices and begin browning the meat. Break up the meat as you cook, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer to a large strainer and drain off the liquid."

- "Add the wine to the pan, along with the tomatoes. Bring this to a slight boil and reduce the heat to low-medium."

- "Next layer the eggplant slices evenly on top and cover with the remaining meat sauce and a light sprinkling of cheese."
- "Pour the béchamel sauce over the top and spread evenly with a large spoon. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and add a light dusting of bread crumbs."
- "Place the dish on a baking sheet (drippings), and bake at 375˚until browned and bubbly, about 45 minutes."
- "Remove from oven and let cool completely. This process will allow the pan ingredients to congeal. [Sliced portions will stay intact and not slide when serving]"
- "When ready to serve, reheat oven at 350˚ and warm the entire pan for 20-25 minutes. Use a spatula to make cuts for individual servings. Top each slice serving with a sprig of parsley."

Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
