Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body.
