How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
