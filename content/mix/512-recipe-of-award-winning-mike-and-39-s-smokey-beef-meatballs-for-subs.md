Tiny meatball subs with red sauce and mozzarella cheese are perfect for entertaining. Combine ground beef, onion, green pepper, crackers, and egg in a large bowl. Season with Worcestershire sauce, garlic, seasoned salt, and pepper; mix well. Meatball sandwiches are one of those hearty meals that I don&#39;t mind eating as a filling lunch or for dinner — whenever the craving hits for some comfort I use a combination of ground pork and beef for a tender and juicy meatball, and everything&#39;s held together with some panko breadcrumbs and an egg.

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
