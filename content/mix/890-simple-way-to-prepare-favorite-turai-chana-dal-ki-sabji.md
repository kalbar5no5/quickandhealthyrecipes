Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
