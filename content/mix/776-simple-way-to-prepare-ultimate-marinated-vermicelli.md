Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
