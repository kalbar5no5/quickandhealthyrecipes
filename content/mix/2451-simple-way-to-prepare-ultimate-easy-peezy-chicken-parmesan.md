Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
