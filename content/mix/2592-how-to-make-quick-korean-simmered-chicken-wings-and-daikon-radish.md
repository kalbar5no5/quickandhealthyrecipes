recipeingredient:
- "4 Chicken drumettes  the first thickest joint of a chicken wing"
- "10 cm Daikon radish"
- "2 clove Garlic"
- "1 tbsp of each Sugar gochujang miso soy sauce"
- "1 dash of each Sesame oil ground sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the surface of the chicken drumettes by dipping them quickly in boiling water. Peel the daikon radish, cut into quarters lengthwise and slice 2 cm thick (into bite-sized pieces). Crush the garlic."
- "Put all the Step 1 ingredients in a pan, add barely enough water to cover them plus the sugar, and heat over medium-high heat. When it comes to a boil turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 10 minutes."
- "Add the gochujang, miso and soy sauce. Cover with a small lid or parchment paper or foil that sits directly on the pan contents (drop lid or otoshibuta) and simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes. If you mix the flavoring ingredients in some of the cooking liquid before adding it to the pan, they will dissolve easier."
- "Turn the heat up to evaporate the cooking liquid at the end, and add the sesame oil. Transfer to a serving plate and scatter one some ground sesame seeds. You can save the cooking liquid to use in another dish."
- "Other ingredients: mid-part of chicken wings, beef tendon, pork belly, burdock root, potatoes, atsuage, konnyaku. I recommend combining umami-rich meat with ingredients that can absorb that umami!"
- "Re-using the cooking liquid: If you chill the cooking liquid in the refrigerator overnight it will become gelatinous. Use it in miso soup, miso ramen, yakisoba (pan-fried noodles), fried rice, stir fries and so on."
- "Or you could combine the liquid with an equal amount of mayonnaise, thin it out with milk and use as a Korean style mayo-sauce. I used it as a sauce for kalamari."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
