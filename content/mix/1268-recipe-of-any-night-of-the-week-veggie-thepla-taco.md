Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
