Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
