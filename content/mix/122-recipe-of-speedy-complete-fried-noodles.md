Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
