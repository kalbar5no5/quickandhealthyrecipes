Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
