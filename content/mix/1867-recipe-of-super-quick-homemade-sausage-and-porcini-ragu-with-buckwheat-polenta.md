Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
