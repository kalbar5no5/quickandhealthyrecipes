Mothers are always looking for quick meals to feed their kids, especially during the week. Between school, after-school activities and homework, not to mention mom&#39;s busy schedule, time is of the essence for a midweek meal. Frozen breaded chicken -- such as patties, strips or nuggets -- can make for a quick meal paired with vegetables and rice. I&#39;ll admit it: I&#39;m a sucker for the frozen food section. Yes, I love to cook and bake from scratch (these from-scratch slow cooker meals are some of my favorites), but the junk foodie in me also loves a good frozen pizza or chicken tenderâ€”especially chicken tenders. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
