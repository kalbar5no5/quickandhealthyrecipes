recipeinstructions:
- "Place the crackers into a ziplock bag and crush them into crumbs. Add melted butter and granulated sugar. The consistency should be like wet sand."
- "Line the pan of your choice with parchment paper, and pour the cracker crumbs into it, press down tightly with a spoon to form the base for the crust. Set aside."
- "In a bowl, beat the whipping cream until it can stand alone (until it is like whipped cream texture). Be careful not to overwhip, because the cream will start to separate into fats and whey. Set the whipped cream aside."

- "Mix together the powdered gelatin with the hot water until it is well dissolved (make sure there are no lumps), and pour into the cream cheese mixture. Mix well."
- "Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Make sure to gently mix, otherwise the cake will not be light and airy. Once well mixed, pour into the pan that holds the already made crust."

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
