Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
