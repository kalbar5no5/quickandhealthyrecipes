Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
