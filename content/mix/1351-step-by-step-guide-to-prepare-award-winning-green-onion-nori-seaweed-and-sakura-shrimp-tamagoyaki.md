Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
