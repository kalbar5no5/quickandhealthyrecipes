Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
