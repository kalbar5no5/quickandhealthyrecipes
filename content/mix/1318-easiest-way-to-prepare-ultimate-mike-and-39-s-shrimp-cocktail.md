Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
