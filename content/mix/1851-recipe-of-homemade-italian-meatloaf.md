Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
