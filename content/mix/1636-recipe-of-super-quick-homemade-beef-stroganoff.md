Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
