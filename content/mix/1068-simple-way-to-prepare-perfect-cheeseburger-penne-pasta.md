Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
