Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
