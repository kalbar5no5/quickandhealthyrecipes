Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
