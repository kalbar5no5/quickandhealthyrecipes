Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
