Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
