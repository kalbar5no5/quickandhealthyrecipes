Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
