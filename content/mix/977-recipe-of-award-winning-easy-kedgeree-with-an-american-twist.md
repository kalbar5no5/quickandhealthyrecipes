- "While waiting for the water to boil, put the mustard seed in the second pan for about a minute, then reduce the heat to medium, occasionally stirring until the seeds begin to pop and brown. Be careful to not burn them."
- "Dump the rest of the curry base on top of the mustard seed and mix together."
- "Now add in the fresh spices into your home made curry mix and continue to mix them in the pan. The water should be starting to boil by now, so reduce it to medium-low heat."

- "Once the rice is hot, and the fish is cooked, place the fish on top of the rice and break apart mixing both of them together. Serve in bowls with a hearty dollop of the sweet chili yogurt dressing to cool off the spiciness of the curry."
- "If you&#39;re not a fan of fish, feel free to remove it from the recipe or replace it with Tofu, baked brussel sprouts, or chicken."

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
