Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
