Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
