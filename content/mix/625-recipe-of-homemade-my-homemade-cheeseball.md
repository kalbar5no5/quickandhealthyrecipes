Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
