It is used in India for making kuzhi appam. This paniyaram turns out so fluffy and taste delicious with chutney or sambar.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
