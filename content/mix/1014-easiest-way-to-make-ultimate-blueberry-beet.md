Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
