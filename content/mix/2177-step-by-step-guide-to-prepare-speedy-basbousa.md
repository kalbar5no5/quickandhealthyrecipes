Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
