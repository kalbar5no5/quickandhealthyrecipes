They turn from green to red when ripe, but are most commonly harvested when green. One in every ten shishito peppers is said to be spicy. Their thin skin blisters and chars easily, which makes them easy to cook! I have an abundance of shishito pepper this year and let a lot of them go red on the bush. Not knowing what to do, and being too cheap to waste them, I dried the peppers and ground them. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
