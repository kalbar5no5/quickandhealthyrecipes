Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
