Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
