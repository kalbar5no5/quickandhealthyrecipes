Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
