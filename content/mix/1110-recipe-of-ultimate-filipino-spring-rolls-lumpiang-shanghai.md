- "1/4 cup green onion finely chopped"
- "1/2 cup carrot finely chopped"

recipeinstructions:
- "Thaw the frozen spring roll wrappers ahead of time by simply taking them out of the freezer and setting them aside at room temperature."
- "Add all ingredients (MINUS the spring roll wrappers, oil, and one egg) in a bowl. We will save the second egg for egg wash later."
- "Mix all ingredients very well. I used a clean hand to do this step."
- "Create an egg wash by beating the leftover egg with 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl."
- "The wrappers I bought were 10&#34; squares. They should be pliable before you separate them. Lay one flat on a clean surface with a corner pointing towards you. In other words, the square wrapper should be oriented in a diamond shape."
- "Take about a tablespoon and a half of the mix, and lay it out across the center of the wrapper. Create a thin log about half an inch tall. The log should not extend to the corners of the wrapper. Leave about 2&#34; of wrapper for covering either end of the log."

- "You can fry this a couple of ways: 1) deep fry at 350° or 2) pan fry on a stove with high heat and enough oil to submerge a roll halfway. The second method will obviously require you to turn the rolls over midway."
- "If deep frying, drop in one roll at a time. I had a gallon of peanut oil in a deep pot, so I was able to cook all the rolls in one go. Remember, do not fill any pot more than halfway with oil when deep frying. Once the rolls are in, time for 10 minutes or until golden brown."
- "If pan frying, fry each roll 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown."
- "Remove from oil, allow to cool, cut each roll in half with kitchen shears, and serve with sweet Thai chili sauce!"

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
