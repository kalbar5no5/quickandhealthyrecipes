How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
