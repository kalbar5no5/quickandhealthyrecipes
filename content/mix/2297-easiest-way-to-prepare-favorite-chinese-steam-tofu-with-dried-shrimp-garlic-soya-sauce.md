A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood.

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
