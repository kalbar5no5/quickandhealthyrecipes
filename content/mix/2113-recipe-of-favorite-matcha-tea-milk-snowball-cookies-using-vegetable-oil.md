Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
