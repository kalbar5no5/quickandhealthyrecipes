Christina Soong-Kroeger recreates her Grandmother&#39;s secret Sambal Udang recipe. I do love a spicy seafood dish. This recipe - Malaysian Sambal Udang (Prawn Sambal) - was created by my paternal Grandmother (my popo) and pieced together painstakingly by my cousin Carina. I&#39;ve adapted it further, as the ingredients are a little different in Australia, to.

This recipe - Malaysian Sambal Udang (Prawn Sambal) - was created by my paternal Grandmother (my popo) and pieced together painstakingly by my cousin Carina. I&#39;ve adapted it further, as the ingredients are a little different in Australia, to. Prawn Sambal (or Sambal Udang, Sambal Shrimp) relies heavily on one of Malaysia&#39;s favorite ingredients, Sambal Sauce. The spicy sauce is a staple in Malaysian cooking. The very basic sauce, Sambal Oelek, is a paste made with fiery red chiles and plus a little salt and/or vinegar. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
