Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
