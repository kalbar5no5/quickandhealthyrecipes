How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
