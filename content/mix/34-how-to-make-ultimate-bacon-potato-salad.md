Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
