Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
