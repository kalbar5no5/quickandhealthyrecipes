Let it cook until the meat is nearly cooked (do not cook the meat fully or it may become dry). Add the aubergine pieces and stir into the mince meat using the wooden spoon. Mix the soya sauce, mirin, sake and caster sugar in a small bowl. If the lotus roots are too thick, you will have problems cooking the beef patty inside, so it is important to slice it thinly. Lotus roots are planted in the soil at the bottom of ponds, and above the water is where the round lotus leaf with their gorgeous lotus flower which most people are familiar is, can be found. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
