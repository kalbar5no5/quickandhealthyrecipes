How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
