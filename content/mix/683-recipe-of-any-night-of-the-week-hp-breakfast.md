Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
