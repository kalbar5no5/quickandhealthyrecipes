Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
