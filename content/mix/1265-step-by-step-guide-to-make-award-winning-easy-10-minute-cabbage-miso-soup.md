Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
