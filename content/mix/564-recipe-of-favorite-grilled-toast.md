In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them.

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
