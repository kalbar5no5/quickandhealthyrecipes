Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
