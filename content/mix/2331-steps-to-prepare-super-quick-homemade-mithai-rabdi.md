Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
