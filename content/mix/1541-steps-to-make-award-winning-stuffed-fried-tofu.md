Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
