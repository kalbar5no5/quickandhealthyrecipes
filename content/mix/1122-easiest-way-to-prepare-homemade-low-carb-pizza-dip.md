Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
