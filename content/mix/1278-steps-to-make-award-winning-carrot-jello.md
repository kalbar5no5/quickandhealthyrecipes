Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
