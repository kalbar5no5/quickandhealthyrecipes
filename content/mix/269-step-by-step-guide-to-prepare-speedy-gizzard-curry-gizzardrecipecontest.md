Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!
