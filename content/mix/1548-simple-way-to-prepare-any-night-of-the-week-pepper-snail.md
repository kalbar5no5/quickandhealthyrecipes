Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
