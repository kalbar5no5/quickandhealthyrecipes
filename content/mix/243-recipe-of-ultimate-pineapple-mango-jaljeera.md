Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
