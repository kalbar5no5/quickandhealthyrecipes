It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better.

The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine.
