Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
