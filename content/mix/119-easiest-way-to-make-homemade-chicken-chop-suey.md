Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
