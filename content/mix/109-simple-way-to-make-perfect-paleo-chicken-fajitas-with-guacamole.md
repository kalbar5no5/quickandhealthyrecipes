Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
