Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
