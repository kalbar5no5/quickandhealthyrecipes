Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
