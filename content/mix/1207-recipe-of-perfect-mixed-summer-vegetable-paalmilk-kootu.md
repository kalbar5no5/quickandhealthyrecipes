Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
