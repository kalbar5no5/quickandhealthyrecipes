Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, oats for breakfast. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Oats for breakfast is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Oats for breakfast is something which I have loved my whole life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

Oats are gluten-free whole grain and a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber. That might be a big batch of stovetop oatmeal that I reheat during the week, individually-portioned creamy overnight oats I can grab as I dash out the door. Nothing against the hot breakfast mush we all know and love, but there are so many ways to use oats in recipes that aren&#39;t oatmeal. We&#39;ve got the best oat recipes covered — from naturally sweetened.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have oats for breakfast using 6 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Oats for breakfast:

1. Take 1/4 cup Organic steel cut oats (150cal)
1. Prepare 1/2 large banana (62 cal)
1. Take 1/2 cup berries (mixed) (35 calories) I normally use frozen ones!
1. Prepare 1/2 tablespoon chia seeds (30 cal)
1. Prepare 1/2 tablespoon sliced almonds (24 cal)
1. Make ready 1 little bit of stevia (depends on your taste, I almost no use anything!)


We usually have Oats for breakfast roughly twice in a week. This saves some work for me for breakfast and jump straight into preparing the dishes for lunch. A lot of us especially kids prefer sugary cereals over healthy oats for breakfast. For many nothing can be great as a warm cup of oats for your breakfast.

##### Instructions to make Oats for breakfast:

1. First use a microwaveable bol and put the oats. I normally cover all the oats with the same volume of water than oats and I let it for 2 minutes. If it is too dry, I put more water, if not, I keep in the microwave 1:30 minutes more
1. At the same time, cut the banana in small pieces and mix everything!
1. You also can put the cinnamon at the end make it even a little more tasty
1. And that’s all!! Just enjoy :)


A lot of us especially kids prefer sugary cereals over healthy oats for breakfast. For many nothing can be great as a warm cup of oats for your breakfast. Make a jar of overnight oats for a nutritious breakfast on-the-go. Combine these tasty oat pots and Bircher mueslis with fruit, nuts, seeds and yogurt. But, eating oats and milk is not sufficient for breakfast. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
