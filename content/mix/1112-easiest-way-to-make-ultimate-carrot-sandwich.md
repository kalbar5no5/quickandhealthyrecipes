Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
