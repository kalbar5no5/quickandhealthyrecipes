Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
