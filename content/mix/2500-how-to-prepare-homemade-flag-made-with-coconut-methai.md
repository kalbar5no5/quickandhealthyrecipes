Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
