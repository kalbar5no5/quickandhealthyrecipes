How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
