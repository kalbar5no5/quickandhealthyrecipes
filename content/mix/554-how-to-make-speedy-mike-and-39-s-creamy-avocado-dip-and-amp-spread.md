Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
