Our fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk which gives it such a tender, moist texture. The best part is the seasoning recipe that&#39;s got great flavor with tons of spices. I must admit, the fried chicken sandwich craze is very widespread these days, but I love mine for its spicy heat and extra crispy texture. Pour buttermilk mixture over chicken and turn pieces to coat evenly. Soaking the chicken overnight in buttermilk helps tenderize it, and the chicken stays tender when you fry it.
