Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
