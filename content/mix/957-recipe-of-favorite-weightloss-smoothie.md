Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
