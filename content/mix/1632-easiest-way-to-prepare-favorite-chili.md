It is a dump and go kind of chili and uses only one pot to make. It is so simple and has SO much flavor. Classic Chili Ingredients There&#39;s a big debacle on the internet whether classic chili has beans or no beans. In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
