Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
