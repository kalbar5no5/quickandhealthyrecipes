Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
