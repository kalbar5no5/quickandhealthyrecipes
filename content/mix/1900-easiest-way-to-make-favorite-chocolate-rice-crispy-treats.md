Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
