Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
