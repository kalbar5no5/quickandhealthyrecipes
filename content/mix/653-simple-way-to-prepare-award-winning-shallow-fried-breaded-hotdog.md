Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
