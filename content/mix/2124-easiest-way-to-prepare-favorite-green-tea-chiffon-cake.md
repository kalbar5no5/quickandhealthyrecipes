Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
