Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
