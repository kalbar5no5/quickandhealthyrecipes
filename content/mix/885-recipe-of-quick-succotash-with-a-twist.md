Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
