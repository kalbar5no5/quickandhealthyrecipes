Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
