Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
