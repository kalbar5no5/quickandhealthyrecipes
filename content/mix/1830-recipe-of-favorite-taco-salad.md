Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
