Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
