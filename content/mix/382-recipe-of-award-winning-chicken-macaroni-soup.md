Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
