Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
