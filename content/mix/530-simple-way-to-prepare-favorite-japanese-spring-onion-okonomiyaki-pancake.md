Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
