Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
