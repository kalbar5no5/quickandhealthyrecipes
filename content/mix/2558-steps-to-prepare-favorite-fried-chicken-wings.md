Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
