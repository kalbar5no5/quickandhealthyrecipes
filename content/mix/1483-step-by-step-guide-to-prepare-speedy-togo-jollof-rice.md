Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
