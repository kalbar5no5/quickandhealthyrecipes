Keep remaining custard chilled until ready to be churned. For this ice cream cake, I topped it with all things chocolate: M&amp;Ms, mini M&amp;Ms, chocolate covered crisps, rolos and kisses. The M&amp;Ms are nice and colorful and since I had vanilla and chocolate ice cream for the cake base, they complimented each other beautifully. Repeat layering with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping, ending with a top layer of whipped topping. Looking for recipes for ice cream cake? 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
