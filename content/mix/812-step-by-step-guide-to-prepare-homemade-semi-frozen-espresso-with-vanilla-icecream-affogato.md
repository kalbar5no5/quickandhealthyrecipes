It is one of my favorite desserts. Espresso affogato is a shot of espresso, usually standard size, poured over a scoop of ice cream, traditionally vanilla. Chill your glass/bowl/mug and make sure your scoop of ice cream is very, very cold and on the large side. This way, not all of the ice cream will melt when the hot liquid is poured over it.

Chill your glass/bowl/mug and make sure your scoop of ice cream is very, very cold and on the large side. This way, not all of the ice cream will melt when the hot liquid is poured over it. I made the espresso, placed a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a cup, and then poured the espresso over. I&#39;m not sure if the first taste was a bite with a spoon or a sip from the cup; but I remember thinking, &#34;holy cow, this is amazing.&#34; Since I recently made espresso ice cream, I wanted to try making an Affogato with it. Pour the espresso over the ice cream. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
