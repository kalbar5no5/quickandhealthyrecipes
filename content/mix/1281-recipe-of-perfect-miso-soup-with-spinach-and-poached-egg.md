Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
