How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
