Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
