Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
