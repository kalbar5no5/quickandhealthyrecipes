Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
