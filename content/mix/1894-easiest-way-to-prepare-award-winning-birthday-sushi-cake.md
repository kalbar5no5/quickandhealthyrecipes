Great for birthdays especially when the birthday person likes sushi more than than sweet desserts. This flower-themed sushi cake ended up looking more like a Mother&#39;s Day cake rather than a birthday cake. If you don&#39;t have a cake pan, you can use a round plastic container instead. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
