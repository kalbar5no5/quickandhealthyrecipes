Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
