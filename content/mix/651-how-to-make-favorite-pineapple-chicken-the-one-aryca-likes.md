Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
