Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
