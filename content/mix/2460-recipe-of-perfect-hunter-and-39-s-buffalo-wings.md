Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
