Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
