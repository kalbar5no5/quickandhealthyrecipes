Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
