Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
