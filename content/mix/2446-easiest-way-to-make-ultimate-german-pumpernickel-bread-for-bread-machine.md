Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
