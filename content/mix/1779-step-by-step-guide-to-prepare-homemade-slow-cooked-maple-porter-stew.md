Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
