Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
