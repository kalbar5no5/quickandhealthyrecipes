Either you can use non-stick appe pan or iron appe pan. It is important to use sour batter. Paniyaram or paddu is the natural successor of idli in my house. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
