Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
