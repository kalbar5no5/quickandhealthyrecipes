How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
