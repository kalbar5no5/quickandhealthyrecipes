Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
