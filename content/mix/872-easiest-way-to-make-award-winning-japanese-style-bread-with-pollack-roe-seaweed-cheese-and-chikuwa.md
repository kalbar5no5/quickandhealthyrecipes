Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
