They always used Swede (Rutabaga)/ Swedish turnip. For the reviewer who has trouble with pastry, me too! Pasties (singular pasty or pastie) are patches that cover a person&#39;s nipples and areolae, typically affixed with adhesive. A pasty (/ ˈpæsti /) is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, United Kingdom. Our decorative pasties come in a variety of colors and styles and are some of the cutest pasties online. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
