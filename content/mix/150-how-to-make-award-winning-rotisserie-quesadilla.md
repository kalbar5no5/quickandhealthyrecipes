Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
