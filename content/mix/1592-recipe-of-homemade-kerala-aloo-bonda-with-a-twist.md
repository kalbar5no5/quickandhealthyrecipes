Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
