Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
