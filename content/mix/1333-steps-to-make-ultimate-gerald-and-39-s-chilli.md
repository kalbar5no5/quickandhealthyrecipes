Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
