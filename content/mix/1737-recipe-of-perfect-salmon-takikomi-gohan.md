How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
