Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
