- "100 grams Flour"
- "1/2 tbsp Baking powder"
- "50 ml Honey"
- "2 tbsp Vegetable oil"
- "100 ml Soy milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the flour and baking powder in a plastic bag, close it up with plenty of air in the bag, and shake to mix. This way you don&#39;t need to sift it."
- "Grate the lotus root: use your fingers to remove the thin membranes in the holes of the root.  Preheat the oven to 180째C."
- "Combine the grated lotus root, honey, vegetable oil and soy milk."
- "Mix the flour combination from step 1 to the mixture from Step 3. It&#39;s hard to tell from the photo, but it&#39;s easier to cut a corner of the bag and add the contents to the bowl rather than opening the bag up."
- "Pour the batter into a lined cake pan. In the photo, I used a cake pan made with newspaper. If you&#39;re using a pound cake tin or a milk carton, the ingredient amounts listed above are fine!"
- "Bake for about 20 minutes in a preheated 180째C oven. If a skewer stuck into the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done. If you want the cake to have a whiter surface, bake covered with a piece of aluminum foil."
- "If you&#39;re topping the cake with lotus root chips: microwave thinly sliced lotus root for 25 minutes. If they&#39;re not crispy enough, heat on a grill (or similar)."

To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook white lotus root cake using 6 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.

1. Pour the batter into a lined cake pan. In the photo, I used a cake pan made with newspaper. If you&#39;re using a pound cake tin or a milk carton, the ingredient amounts listed above are fine!
1. Bake for about 20 minutes in a preheated 180째C oven. If a skewer stuck into the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done. If you want the cake to have a whiter surface, bake covered with a piece of aluminum foil.
1. If you&#39;re topping the cake with lotus root chips: microwave thinly sliced lotus root for 25 minutes. If they&#39;re not crispy enough, heat on a grill (or similar).


Add in the flour, eggs, baking powder and vanilla and beat again briefly till combined - try not to overbeat! I suddenly got the idea to make white and black vegetable-based cakes! Black would be burdock root, and white. I decided to try lotus root, keeping to the root vegetable family! Since lotus root becomes sticky and doughy when heated, I thought maybe I can use it instead of eggs. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
