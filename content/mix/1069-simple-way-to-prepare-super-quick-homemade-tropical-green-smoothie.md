Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
