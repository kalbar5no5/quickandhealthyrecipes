Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
