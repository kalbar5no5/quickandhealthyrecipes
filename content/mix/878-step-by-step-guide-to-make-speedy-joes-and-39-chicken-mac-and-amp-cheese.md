Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
