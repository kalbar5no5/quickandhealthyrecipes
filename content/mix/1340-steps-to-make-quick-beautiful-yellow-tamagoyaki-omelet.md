Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
