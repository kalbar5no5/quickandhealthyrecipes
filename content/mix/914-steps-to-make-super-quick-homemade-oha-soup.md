Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
