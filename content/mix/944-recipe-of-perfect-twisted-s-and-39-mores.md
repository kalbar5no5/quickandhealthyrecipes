Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
