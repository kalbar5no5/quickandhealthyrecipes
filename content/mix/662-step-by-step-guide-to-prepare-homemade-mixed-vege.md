Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
