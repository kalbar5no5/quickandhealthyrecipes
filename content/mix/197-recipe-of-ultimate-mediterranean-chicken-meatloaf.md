Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
