Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
