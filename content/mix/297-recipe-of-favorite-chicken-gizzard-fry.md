Place drained gizzards on paper toweling, and pat dry. Salt and Pepper both sides of the gizzards. In a large zippy bag, place flour and salt and pepper. The gizzard and heart can yield some of the toughest bites you&#39;ll find in a chicken; both organs get a lot of work throughout the life of the bird and won&#39;t gracefully reach tenderness when fried without a little coaxing. This Chicken Gizzards recipe simmers the gizzards for over an hour so you get the most tender result. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
