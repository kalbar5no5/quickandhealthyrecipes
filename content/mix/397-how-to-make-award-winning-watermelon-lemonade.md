Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
