Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
