Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
