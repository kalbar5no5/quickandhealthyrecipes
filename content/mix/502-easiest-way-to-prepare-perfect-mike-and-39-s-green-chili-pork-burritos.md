Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
