I also spiced up the meatballs with some stand-by italian spices (basic, oregano, etc.) and I upped the garlic (to taste). Also, I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs, and used a little less than called for.

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
