Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
