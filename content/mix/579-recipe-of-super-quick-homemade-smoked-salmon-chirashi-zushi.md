Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
