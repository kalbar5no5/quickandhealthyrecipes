Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
