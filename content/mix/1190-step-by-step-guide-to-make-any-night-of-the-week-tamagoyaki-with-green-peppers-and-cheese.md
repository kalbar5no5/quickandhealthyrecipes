Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
