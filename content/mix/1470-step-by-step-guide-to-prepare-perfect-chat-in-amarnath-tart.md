Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
