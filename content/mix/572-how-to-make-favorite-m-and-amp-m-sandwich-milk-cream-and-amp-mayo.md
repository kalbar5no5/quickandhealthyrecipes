Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
