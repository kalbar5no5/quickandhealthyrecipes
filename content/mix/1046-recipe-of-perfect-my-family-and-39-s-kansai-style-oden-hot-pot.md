Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
