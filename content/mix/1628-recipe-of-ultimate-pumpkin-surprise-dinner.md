Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
