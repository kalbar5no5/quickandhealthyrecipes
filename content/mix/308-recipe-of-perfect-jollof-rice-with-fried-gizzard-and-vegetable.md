Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
