How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
