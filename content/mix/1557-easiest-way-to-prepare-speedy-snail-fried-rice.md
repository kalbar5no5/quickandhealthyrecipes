Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
