Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
