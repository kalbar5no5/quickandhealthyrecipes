Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
