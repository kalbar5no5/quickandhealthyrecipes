Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
