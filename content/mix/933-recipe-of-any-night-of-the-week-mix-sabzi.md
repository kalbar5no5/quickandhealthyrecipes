Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
