A chicken patty can refer to a few different ways to prepare chicken. The first is a simple chicken breast, typically breaded and fried and served on a roll or on bread. The second is a type of formed patty made of shredded chicken as well as pepper, spices, and other flavorful ingredients, and is also then breaded and fried. Chicken Patties, succulent little morsels of chicken, bread crumbs, and seasonings are FUN to dip in homemade Tzatziki or BBQ sauce or Honey Mustard.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
