Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!
