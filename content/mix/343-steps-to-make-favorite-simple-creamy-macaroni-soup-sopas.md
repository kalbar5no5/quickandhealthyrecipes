Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
