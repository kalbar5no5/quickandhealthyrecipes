Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
