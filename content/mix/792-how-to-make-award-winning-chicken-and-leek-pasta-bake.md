Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
