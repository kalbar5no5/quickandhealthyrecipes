- "B - In a bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attached, mix 2 tbsp of corn oil, 1 tsp of salt, 600 g of flour and yeast mixture on low speed for 5 minutes or until dough comes together. Increase speed to medium and keep kneading for another 12-15 minutes until dough is elastic and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Transfer dough to a greased bowl. Cover and leave dough to proof or double its size. It&#39;ll take 1 hour or more."
- "Transfer dough to a floured working top. Gently punch dough down and divide into preferred equal portions. This recipe yields 8 balls weighing around 117g-120g each. Next, roll these portions lightly into balls. Then, mark an &#39;X&#39; on top of each ball using a sharp knife. Just a thin slice. Place balls onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Space them several inches apart."
- "Cover with a greased cling film and leave these balls to rise for 40 minutes or until they double in size. Brush each ball with a thin layer of egg wash before baking. Preheat oven to 150-160°C (depending on the oven). Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and brush a thin layer of melted butter on the hot buns (optional). Leave buns to cool."
- "Note: This bread dough can be made in a bread maker too. Just leave A to proof, then transfer it to a bread pan and add B. Press the ‘dough’ function and leave the the machine to do its job until it beeps and stops. Then, continue to step 3."
- "D. Soup - cube potatoes and boil until tender. Put aside. Boil cauliflower until soft. Drain and put aside. Next, sautè sliced brown onion until translucent, add cauliflower and stir for few minutes before adding milk. Simmer and add in corn flour mixture, keep simmering and stirring until sauce is slightly thickened. Season with chicken seasoning powder and ground pepper. Turn the heat off. Using a handstick blender, puree soup until smooth. Return to the heat and add cooked cubed potato last."
- "Note: This bread bowl holds any creamy soups very well. Use it to serve mushroom soup, tomato soup or even macaroni and cheese."
- "To serve - Cut the top of the bread and scoop out the center. Brush the inner part with garlic spread. Brushing with garlic spread and heating it in the oven after that is optional. Fill this bread bowl with any creamy or thick soups. Garnish with grated cheese, finely chopped parsley or any meat bits. Serve warm."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
