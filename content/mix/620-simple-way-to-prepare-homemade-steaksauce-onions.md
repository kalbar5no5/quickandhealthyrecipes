Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
