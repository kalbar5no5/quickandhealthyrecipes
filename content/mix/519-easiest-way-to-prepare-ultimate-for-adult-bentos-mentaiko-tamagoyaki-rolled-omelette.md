Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
