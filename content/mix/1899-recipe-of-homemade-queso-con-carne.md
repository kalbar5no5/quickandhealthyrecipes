Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
