Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
