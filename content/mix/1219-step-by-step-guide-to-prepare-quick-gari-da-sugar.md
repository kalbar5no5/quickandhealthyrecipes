Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!
