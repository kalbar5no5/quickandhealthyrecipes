Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
