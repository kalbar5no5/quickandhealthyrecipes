How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
