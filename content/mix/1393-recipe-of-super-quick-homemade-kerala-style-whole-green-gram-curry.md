Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
