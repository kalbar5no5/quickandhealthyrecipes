Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
