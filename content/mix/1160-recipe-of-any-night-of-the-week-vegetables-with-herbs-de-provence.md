Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
