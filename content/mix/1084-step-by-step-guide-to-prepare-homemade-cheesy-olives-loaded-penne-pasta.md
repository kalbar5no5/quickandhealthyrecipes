Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
