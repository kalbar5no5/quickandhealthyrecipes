Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
