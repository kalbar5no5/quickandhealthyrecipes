Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
