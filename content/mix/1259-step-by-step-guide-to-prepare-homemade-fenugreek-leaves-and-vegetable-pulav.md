Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
