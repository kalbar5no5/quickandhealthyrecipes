Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
