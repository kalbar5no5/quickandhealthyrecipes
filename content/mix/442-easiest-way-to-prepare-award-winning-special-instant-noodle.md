Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
