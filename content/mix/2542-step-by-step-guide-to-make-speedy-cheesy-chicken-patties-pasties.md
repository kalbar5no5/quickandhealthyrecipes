Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
