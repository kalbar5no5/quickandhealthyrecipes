Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
