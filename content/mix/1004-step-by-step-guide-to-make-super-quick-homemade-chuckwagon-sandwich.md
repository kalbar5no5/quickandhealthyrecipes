Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
