How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
