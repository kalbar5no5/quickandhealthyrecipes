Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
