The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
