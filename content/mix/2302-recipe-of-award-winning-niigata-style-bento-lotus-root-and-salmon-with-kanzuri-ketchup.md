Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
