Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
