Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
