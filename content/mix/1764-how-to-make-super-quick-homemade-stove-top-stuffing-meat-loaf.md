Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
