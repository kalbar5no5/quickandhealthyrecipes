Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
