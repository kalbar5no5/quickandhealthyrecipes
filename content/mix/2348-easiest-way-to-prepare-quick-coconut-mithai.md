Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
