Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
