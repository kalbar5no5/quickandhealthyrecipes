Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
