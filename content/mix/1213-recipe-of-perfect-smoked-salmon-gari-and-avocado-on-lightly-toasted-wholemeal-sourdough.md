How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
