Shrimp Creole is another favorite Cajun/Creole dish. Traditionally, Shrimp Creole is a Creole recipe from New Orleans. Shrimp Creole only differs slightly from Shrimp Etouffee in that tomato sauce is added to the Roux and great big jumbo Gulf of Mexico shrimp of course. First, Shrimp Creole, or as it was once known, Shrimp a la Creole, is a New Orleans dish. Shrimp Sauce Piquant is Acadian, much spicier (hence the name) and usually, but not always containing a roux. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
