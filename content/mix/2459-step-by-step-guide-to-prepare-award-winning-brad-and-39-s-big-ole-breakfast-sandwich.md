Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
