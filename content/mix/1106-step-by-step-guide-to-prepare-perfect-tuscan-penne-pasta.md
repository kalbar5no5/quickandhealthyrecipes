Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
