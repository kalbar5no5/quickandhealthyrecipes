Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
