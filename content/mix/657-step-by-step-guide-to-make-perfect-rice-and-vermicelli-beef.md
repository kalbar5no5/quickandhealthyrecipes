Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
