Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
