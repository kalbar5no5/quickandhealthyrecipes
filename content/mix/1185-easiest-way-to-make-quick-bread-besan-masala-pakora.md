Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
