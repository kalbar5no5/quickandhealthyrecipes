Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
