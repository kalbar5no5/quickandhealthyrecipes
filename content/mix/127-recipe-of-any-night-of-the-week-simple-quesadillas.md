Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
