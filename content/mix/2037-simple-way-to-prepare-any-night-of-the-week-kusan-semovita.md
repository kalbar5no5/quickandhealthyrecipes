Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
