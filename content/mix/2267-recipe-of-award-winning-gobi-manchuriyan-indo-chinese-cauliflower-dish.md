Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
