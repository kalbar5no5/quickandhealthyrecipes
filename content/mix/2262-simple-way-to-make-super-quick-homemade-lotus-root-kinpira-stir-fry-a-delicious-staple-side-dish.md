How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
