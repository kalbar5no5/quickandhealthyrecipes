Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
