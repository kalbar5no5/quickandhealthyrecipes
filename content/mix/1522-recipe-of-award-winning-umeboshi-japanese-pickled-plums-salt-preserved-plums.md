Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
