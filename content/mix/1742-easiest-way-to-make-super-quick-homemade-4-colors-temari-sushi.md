Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
