Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
