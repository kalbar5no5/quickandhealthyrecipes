Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
