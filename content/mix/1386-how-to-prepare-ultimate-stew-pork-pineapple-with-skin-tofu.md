Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
