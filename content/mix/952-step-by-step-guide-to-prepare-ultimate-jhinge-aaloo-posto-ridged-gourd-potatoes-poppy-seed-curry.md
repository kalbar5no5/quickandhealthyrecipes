Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
