Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
