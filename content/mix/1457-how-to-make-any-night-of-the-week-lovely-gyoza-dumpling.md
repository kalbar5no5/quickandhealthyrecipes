Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
