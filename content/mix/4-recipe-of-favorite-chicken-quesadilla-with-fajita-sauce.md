Flour tortillas get filled with chicken, fajita veggies and pepper Jack for a melty weeknight dinner the whole family will love. Chicken Quesadillas with sautéed onions, green peppers, seasoned chicken, and melted cheese in a crispy tortilla. I do love fajitas, but the servings are generally just too large. But put that in a cheesy quesadilla, and you have a great dish. It is not a hard recipe, and it uses common pantry ingredients. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
