Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
