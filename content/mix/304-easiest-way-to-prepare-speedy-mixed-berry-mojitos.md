How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
