Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
