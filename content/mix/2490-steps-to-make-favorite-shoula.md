Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
