Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
