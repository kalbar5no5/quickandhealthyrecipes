Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
