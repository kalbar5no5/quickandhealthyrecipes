Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood.

Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
