Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
