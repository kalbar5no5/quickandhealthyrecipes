How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
