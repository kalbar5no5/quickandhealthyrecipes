How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
