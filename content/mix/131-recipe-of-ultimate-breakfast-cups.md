- "Carefully drop a whole egg yolk on top of the cheese, you want them to be in the centre, so make a little dip in the cream/cheese mixture to drop the yolk into. Then spoon the rest of the whisked egg and cream mixture on top."
- "Finally, top with another pinch of cheese (not too much) and a sprinkling of paprika or smoked paprika."
- "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes (or around 15-20 minutes if you haven&#39;t partially cooked the bases) until the centres are just set and the cases are crisp. Serve warm rather than piping hot, with ketchup."

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
