Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
