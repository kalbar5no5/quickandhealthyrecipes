How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
