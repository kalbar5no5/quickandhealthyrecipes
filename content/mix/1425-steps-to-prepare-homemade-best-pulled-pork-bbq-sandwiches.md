Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
