Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
