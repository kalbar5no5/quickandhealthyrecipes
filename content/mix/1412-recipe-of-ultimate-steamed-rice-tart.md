Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine.
