Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
