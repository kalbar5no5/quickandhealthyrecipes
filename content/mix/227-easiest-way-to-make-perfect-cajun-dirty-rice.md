Serve it as a kicked-up side any day of the week with a generous drizzle of hot sauce on the side. This louisiana stable, Dirty Rice, is a rice pilaf style dish. It is traditionally made with finely diced chicken livers, ground sausage, cajun seasonings, and the Cajun holy trinity: onion, green bell pepper and celery. If you aren&#39;t a liver lover, no worries, you can also use a combination of ground beef and pork like I do. Dirty Rice is a spicy and flavorful Cajun rice dish made from white rice. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
