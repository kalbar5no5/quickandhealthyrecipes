Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
