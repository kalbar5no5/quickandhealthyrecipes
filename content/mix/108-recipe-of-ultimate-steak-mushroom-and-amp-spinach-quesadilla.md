Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
