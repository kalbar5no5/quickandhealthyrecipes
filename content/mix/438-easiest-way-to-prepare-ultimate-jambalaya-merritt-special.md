Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
