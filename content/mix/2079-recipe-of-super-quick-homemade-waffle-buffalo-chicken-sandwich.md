Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
