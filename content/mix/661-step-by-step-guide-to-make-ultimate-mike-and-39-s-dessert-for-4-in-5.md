Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
