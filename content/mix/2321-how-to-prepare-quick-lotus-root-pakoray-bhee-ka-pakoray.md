Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
