Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
