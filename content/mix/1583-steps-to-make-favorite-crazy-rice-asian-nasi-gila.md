Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
