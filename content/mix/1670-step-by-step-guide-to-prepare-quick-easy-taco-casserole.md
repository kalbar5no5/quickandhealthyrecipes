Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
