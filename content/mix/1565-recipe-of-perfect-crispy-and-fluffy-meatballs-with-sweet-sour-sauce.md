Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
