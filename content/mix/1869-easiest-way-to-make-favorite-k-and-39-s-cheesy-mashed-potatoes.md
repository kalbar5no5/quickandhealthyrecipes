Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
