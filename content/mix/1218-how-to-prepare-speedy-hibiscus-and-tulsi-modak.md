Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
