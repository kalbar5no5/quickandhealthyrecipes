How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
