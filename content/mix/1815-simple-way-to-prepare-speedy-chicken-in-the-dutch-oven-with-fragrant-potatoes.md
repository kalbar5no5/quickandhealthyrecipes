Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
