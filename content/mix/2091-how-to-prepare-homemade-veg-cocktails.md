Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
