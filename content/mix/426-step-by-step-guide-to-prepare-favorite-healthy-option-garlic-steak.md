Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
