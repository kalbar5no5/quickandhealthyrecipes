Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
