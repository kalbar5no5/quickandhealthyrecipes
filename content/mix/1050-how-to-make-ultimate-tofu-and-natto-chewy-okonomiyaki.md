Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, tofu and natto chewy okonomiyaki. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Add okonomiyaki flour, tofu, and water into a bowl. Great recipe for Ultra-Healthy No-Flour Okonomiyaki. I always used firm tofu and nagaimo yam in my okonomiyaki, so I tried omitting the flour from the batter when I was on a diet. The batter is very soft, so it&#39;s a bit difficult to flip over.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tofu and natto chewy okonomiyaki using 8 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

The okonomiyaki are also great if topped with spicy chilli oil (ra-yu). My family loves okonomiyaki and I make it at least once a week. For this version, I used koya tofum which is low in carbohydrates, has a long shelf life, and is inexpensive. It has the characteristic chewy texture of koya tofu with the flavor of tofu. It differs from regular okonomiyaki, but you. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
