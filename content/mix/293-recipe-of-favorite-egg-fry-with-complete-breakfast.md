Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
