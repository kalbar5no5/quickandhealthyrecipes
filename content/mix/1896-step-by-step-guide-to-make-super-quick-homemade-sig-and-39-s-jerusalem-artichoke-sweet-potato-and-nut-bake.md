Pour over the potato bake and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes are simply cleaned, then sliced in halves. Toss in oil, salt and thyme and bake until golden and crispy. Since the previous snack experiment went well and the sweet potato crisps pretty much got devoured the same evening, I decided to give it a go with some other vegetables. I happened to have a kilo of Jerusalem artichokes around and assumed they would make lovely crispy treats as well. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
