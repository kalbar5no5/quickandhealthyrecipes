Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
