Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
