Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
