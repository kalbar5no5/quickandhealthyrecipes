How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
