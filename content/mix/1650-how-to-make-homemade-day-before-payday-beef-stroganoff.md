Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
