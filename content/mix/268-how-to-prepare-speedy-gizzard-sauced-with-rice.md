Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
