Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
