Recipe v Video v Dozer v. So many Poke Bowl recipes disappoint with bland dressings and tasteless riceâ€¦. Homemade really IS tastier, you get to top it with what you want and it&#39;s a heck of a lot. I know poke bowls normally consist of raw salmon, but I&#39;m not quite ready for a full-on cold food for dinner just yet. The seared steak makes a great alternative, until we&#39;re closer to the summer months! 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
