Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
