Place tart pan on a baking sheet. A chocolate tart is a simple dessert involving dark chocolate, cream, and other ingredients mixed together and baked in a pie crust. Often called a chocolate cream pie, the filling has a thick, mousse-like texture, but stable at room temperature. However, in my version, no baking is required.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
