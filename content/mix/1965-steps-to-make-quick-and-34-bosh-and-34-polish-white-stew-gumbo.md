Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
