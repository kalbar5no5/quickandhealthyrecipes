Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
