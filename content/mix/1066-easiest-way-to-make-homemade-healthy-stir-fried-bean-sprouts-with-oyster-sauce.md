Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
