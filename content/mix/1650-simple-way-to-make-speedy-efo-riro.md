Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
