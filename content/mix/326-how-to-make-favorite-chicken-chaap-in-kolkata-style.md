Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
