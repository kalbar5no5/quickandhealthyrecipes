Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
