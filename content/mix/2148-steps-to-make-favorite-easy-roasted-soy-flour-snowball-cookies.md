Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
