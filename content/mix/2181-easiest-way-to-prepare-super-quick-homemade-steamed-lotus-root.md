Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
