Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
