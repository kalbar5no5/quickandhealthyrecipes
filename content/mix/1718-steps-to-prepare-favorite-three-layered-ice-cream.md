Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
