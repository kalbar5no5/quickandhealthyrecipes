Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
