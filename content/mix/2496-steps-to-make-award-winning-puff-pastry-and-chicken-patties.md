Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
