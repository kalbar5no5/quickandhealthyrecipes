Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
