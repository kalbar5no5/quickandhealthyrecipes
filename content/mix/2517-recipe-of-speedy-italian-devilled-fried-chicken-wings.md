Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
