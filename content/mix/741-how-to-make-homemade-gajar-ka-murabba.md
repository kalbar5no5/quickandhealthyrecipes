Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
