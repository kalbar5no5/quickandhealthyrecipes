Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
