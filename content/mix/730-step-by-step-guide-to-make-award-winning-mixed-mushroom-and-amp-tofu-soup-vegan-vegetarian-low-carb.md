Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
