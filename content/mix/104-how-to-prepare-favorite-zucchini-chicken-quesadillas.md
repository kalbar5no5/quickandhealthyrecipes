Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
