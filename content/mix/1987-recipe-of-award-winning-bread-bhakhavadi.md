Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
