Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
