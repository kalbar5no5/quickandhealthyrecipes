Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
