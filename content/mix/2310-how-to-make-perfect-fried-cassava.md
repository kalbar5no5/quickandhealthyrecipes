Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
