Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
