Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
