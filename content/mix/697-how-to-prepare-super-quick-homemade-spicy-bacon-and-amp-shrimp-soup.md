Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
