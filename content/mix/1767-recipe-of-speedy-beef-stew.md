Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
