Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
