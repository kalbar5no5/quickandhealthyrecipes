Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
