Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
