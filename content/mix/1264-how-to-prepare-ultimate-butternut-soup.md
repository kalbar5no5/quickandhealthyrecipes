Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
