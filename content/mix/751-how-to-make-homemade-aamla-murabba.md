Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
