In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs and sour cream, if using, until frothy. When butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and add beaten. Finely ground white pepper is traditionally used in French-style scrambled eggs, omelets, and cream sauces because it blends in. Black pepper is a fine substitution.; Additional ingredients, especially ones with a lot of moisture in them like tomatoes or onions, can throw off the timing, and your eggs can come out watery. Don&#39;t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
