Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
