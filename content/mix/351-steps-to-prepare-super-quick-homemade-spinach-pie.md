Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
