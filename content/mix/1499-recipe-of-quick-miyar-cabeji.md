Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
