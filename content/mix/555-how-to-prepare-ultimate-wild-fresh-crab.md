recipeinstructions:
- "First step, fillet down your trout making sure there is no bones. Vac pack the fillets in a bit of butter (I like to add garlic, lemon, rosemary &amp; thyme) then water bath for a 45 mins at 62 degrees.  Pick down your claw meat and gently squeeze out the excesses liquids, wrapping in cloth with bit of salt to rest."
- "Now it’s time to make the base of the dish. Blend up the cucumbers &amp; strain them to reduce the liquid (I pass around 4-5 times).  Bloom and melt your gelatine mix together slowly, don’t heat the cucumber juice. Then place the bowls in the fridge and blow torch the tops to remove any bubbles and leave to set."
- "Pick down your fennel for garnish, now bring some oil up in a pan to a temperature you can just happily put your finger in. Slice up the fennel &amp; add to oil, now blend and pass through a fine cloth in the fridge.  Now, boil your rice up till it’s a fluffy texture then drain the water and add the black olives. Season to taste.  Using a hand blender make the paste as smooth as possible, spread out the paste thin and allow to dry (this is your black olive garnish)."
- "Use your imagination to create your plate. I picked down the flakes of the trout, shaped the crab &amp; naturally allowed the caviar to form.  Dress up the plate, oil and serve chilled (on ice for best result)."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
