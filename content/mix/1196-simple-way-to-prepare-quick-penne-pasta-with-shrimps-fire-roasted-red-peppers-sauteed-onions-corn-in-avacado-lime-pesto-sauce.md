Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
