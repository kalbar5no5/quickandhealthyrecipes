Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
