Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
