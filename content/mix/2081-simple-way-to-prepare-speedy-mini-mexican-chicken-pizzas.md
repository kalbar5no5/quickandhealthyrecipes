Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
