Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
