1. In the same pan (you can quickly clean it a or leave with the tofu flavours, totally optional) add more olive oil and allow to heat up. Once hot add onions. Fry them until they get a bit of colour. Then add the peppers and cook for a further few minutes.
1. Add your tomato&#39;s and allow to cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring as little as possible. During this, mix together your brown sugar, ginger paste, garlic paste, chilli oil, safflower/saffron and gochujang in a bowl.
1. Then add in the green beans and small corn. Cook for another minute and add the pok choi and spring onion. Let it cook for another minute before adding in your mixed paste. Allow that to cook for a further minute.

1. Finally, add the spinach. Allow to cook for a further minute before adding the pre-cooked tofu. (this is when I do the Noodles. Do it according to the packet)
1. Serve with whatever you would like or using what i used and enjoy


Once meat is cooked, add gochujang and stir frequently to prevent burning. Remove the pot from heat and mix in the coconut sugar and lime juice for the perfect amount of sweetness and acidity. It&#39;ll be quite hot, so be careful when you serve it. The coconut curry soup itself isn&#39;t spicy, so feel free to add some Sriracha on top (make sure it&#39;s vegan because some have fish sauce) or what we did which was to add lots of my scotch bonnet pepper sauce into it. The way the carrot flavour of that hot sauce blends into this soup is truly fantastic. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
