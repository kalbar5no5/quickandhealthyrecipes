Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
