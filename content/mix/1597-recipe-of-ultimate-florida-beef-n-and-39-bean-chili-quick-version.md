Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
