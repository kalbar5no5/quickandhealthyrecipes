Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
