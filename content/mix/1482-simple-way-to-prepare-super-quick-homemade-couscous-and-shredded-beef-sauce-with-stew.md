Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!
