Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
