Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
