Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
