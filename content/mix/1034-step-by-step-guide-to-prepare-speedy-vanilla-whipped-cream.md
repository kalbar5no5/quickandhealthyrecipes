Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
