Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
