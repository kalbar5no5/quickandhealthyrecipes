Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
