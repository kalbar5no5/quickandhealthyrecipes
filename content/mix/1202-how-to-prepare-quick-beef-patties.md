Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
