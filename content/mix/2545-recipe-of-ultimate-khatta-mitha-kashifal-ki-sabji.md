Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
