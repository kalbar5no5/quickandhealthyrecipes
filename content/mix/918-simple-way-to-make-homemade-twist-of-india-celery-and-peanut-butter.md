Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression.

They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
