Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
