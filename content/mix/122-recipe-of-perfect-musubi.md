Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
