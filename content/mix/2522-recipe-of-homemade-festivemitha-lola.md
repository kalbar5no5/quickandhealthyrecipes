Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
