Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
