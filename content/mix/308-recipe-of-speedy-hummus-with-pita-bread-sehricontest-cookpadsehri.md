Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
