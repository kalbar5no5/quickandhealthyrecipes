Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
