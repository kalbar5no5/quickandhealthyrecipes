Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
