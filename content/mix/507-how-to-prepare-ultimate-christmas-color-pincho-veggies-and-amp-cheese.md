Significance Of The Colors Of Christmas Green: The color green has been considered the color of life and mystery, even before Jesus Christ was born. While every other tree dies during the winter, only holly bushes and fir trees remain evergreen. People probably thought that it was some kind of magic that helped these trees survive the harsh. Spots like Target or your local craft store are usually brimming with chic and cheap decorative goodies. Take these hanging copper planters, for example, used by blogger Liz Marie to create an alternative to the traditional front door holiday wreath. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
