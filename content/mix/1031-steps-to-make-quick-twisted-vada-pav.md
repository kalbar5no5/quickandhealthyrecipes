Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
