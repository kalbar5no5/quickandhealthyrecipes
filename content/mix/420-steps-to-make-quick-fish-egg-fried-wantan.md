Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
