Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
