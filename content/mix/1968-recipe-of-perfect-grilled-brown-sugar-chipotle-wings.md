Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
