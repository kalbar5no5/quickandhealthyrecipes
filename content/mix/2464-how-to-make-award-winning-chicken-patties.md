Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
