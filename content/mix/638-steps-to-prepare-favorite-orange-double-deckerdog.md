How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
