Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
