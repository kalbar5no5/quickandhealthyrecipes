How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
