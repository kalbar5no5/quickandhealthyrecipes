Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
