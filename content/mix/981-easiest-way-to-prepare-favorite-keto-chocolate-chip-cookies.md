Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
