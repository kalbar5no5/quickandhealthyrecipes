Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!
