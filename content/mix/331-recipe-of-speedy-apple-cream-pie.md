Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
