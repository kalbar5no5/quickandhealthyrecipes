Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
