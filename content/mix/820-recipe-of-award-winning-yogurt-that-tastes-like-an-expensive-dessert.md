Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
