Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
