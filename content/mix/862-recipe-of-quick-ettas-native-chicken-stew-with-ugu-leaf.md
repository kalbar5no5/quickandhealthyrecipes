Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
