Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
