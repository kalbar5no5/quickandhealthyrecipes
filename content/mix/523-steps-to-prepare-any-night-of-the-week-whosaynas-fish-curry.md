Fish is one of the favorite sea foods at home and most times it is the fish fry or the pepper fish that is made as they are quick to make. I rarely make fish curry at home in Singapore as we do not like the taste of the variety we get here. This simple curry is a family favourite at our house, and is a great dish to cook if your own family is a little apprehensive about fish. Choose a mild fish, and the bold flavours of the curry, combined with the creaminess of the coconut milk, are bound to win over even the most skeptical eaters.

The secret for a GREAT Red Thai fish curry is, of course, a really good-quality red curry paste, and the best fish you can find out there. **This post is sponsored by The Cornish Fishmonger. Add the fish fillets, turning to coat. Another coastal region that is the hub of seafood is Goa where Mackerel and King Fish are widely. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
