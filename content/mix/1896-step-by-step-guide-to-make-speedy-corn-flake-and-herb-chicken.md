Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
