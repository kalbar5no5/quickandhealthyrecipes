Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
