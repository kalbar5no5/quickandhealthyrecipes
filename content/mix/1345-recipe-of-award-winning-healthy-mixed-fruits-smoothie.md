Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
