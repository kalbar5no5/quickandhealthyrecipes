Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
