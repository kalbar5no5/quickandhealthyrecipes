Store the chocolates between sheets of butter or parchment paper in airtight containers in the fridge. It can be stored in the freezer too and thaw in fridge when needed."
- "Use the best quality of chocolate which is at least 60% but not grated than 75% or they will turn bitter!  If you are not a fan of dark chocolate, you can use milk chocolate too.  If the bars tend to melt while cutting, return to fridge for a few minutes and then continue to cut.  Best enjoyed fresh, within a week. Enjoy!!"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
