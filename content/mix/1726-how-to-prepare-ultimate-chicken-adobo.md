Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
