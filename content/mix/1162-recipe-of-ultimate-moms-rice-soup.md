Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
