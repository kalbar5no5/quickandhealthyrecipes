Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
