Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
