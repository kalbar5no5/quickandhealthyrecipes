Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
