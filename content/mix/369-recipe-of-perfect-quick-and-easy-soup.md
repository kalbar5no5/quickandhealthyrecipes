Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
