Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
