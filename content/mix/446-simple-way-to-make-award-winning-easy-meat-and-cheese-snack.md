Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
