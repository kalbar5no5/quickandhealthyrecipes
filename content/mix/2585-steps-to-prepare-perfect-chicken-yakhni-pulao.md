Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
