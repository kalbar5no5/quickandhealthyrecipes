Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
