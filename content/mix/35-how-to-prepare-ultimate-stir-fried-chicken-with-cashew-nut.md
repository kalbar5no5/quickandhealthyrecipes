Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
