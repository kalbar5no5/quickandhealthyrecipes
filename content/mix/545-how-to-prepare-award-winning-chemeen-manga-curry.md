Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
