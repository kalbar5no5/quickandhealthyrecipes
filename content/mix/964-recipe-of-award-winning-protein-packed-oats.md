Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
