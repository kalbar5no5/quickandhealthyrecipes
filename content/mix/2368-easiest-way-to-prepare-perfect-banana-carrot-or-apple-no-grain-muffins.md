Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
