Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!
