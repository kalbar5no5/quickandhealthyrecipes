Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
