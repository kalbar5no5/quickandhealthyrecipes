Coconut shrimp is one of my favorite appetizers. There is nothing not to love about crispy and crunchy breadcrumb coated fried shrimp, with sweet coconut flakes, and served with a sauce! The shrimp are sweet and juicy, while the coconut crust is crispy - without being greasy. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
