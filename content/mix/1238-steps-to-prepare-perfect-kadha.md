Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
