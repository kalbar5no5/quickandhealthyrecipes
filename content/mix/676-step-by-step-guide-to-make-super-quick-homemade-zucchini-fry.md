Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
