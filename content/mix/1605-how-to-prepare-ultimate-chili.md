It is a dump and go kind of chili and uses only one pot to make. It is so simple and has SO much flavor.

In my opinion, the best chili recipe is a base of ground beef, tomato, spices, and BEANS. I love the number of fiber beans add to this dish and I promise you won&#39;t regret adding them. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
