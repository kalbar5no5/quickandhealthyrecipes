Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided.

There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk.

Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest.
