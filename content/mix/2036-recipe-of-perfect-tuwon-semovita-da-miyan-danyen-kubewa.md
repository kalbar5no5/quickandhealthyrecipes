Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
