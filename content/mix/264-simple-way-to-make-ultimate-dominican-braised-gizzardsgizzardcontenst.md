Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
