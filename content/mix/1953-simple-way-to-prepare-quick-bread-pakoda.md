Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
