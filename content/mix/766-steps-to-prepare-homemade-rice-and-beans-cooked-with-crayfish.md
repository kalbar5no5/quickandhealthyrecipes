Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
