Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
