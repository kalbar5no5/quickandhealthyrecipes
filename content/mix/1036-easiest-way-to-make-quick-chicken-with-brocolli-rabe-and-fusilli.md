Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
