Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!
