Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
