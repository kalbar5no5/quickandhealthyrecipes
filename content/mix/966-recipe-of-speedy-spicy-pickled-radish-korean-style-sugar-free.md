- "2 packets (2 g) Stevia or to taste"

recipeinstructions:
- "I soaked my radish in the fridge in water before I made the recipe. Threw away the water before I added the vinegar. So no need to dilute your vinegar unless you want to reduce tanginess. Add water according to your preference."
- "Combine all ingredients in a container. If you are using all of the radish, make sure the vinegar is enough to reach the radish on the top. Adjust according to sweetness or tanginess, recommended ratio is 1:1 if you are using real sugar (or less if you don&#39;t like it too sweet). I used Stevia packets, which is sweeter so I used less. To make it spicy, any Gochujang brand is okay. Don&#39;t forget to add salt."
- "Refrigerate overnight and enjoy it the following day. :)"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
