Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
