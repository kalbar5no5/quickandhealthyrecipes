Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
