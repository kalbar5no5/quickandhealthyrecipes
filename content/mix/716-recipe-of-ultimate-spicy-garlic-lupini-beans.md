How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
