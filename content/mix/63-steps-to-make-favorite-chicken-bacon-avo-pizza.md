Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
