Heat oil in a sauce pan. Let it cook till it turns white. Szechuan Hot and Sour Soup is a weakness of mine, mostly because of the of the sour part. I&#39;ve had a few of them at Chinese buffets here stateside but for some reason, they are just not as sour as they&#39;re supposed to be.

Szechuan Hot and Sour Soup is a weakness of mine, mostly because of the of the sour part. I&#39;ve had a few of them at Chinese buffets here stateside but for some reason, they are just not as sour as they&#39;re supposed to be. Cook noodles according to package directions. No, this soup is imbued with the haunting aroma of star anise and cinnamon, and tickled by the numbing sensation of Sichuan pepper. A sprinkling of chopped chile completes this assertive bowl of soup, which comes together surprisingly fast. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
