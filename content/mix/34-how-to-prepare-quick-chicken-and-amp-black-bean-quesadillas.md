Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!
