Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
