Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
