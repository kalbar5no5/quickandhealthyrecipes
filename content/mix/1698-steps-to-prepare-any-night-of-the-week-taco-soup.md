Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
