Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
