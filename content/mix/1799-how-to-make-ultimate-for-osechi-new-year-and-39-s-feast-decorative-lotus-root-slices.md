Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
