Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
