Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
