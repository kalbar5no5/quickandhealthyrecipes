Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
