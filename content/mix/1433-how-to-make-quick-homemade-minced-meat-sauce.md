Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
