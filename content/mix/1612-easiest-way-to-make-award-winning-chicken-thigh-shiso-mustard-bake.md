Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
