Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
