Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
