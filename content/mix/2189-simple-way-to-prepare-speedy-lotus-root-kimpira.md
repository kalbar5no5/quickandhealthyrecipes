Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
