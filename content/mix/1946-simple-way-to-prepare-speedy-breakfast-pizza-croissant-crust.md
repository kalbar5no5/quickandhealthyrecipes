How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
