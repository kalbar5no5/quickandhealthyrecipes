How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
