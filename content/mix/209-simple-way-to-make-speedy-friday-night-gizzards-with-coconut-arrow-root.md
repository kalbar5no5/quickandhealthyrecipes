Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
