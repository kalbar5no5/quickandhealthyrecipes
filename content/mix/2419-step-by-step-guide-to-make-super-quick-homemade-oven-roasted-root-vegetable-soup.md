Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
