Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
