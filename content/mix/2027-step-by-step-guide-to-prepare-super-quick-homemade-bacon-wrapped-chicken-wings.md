How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
