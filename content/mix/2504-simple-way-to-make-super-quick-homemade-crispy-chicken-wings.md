Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
