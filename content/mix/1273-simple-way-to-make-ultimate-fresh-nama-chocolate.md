Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
