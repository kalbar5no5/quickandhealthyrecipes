Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
