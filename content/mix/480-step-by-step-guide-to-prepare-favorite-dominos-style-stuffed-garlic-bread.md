Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
