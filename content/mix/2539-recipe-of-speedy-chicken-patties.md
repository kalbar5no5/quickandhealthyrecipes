Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
