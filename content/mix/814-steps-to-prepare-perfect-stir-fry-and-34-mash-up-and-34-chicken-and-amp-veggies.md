Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
