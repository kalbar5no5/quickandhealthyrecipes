Red-eye gravy is typical to Kentucky/the Carolinas, some in Georgia or Alabama, far enough up (you&#39;ll see stuff called red-eye farther down and it might be the real thing but they had to import a country ham). We don&#39;t have the true country ham in Lousiana so down here the grits are with a meat gravy in grillades. Our annual Grits &amp; Gravy fundraising event was a great turn out!! 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
