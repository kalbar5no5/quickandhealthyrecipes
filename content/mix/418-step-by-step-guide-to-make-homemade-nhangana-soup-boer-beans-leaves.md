Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
