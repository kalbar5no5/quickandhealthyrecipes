Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
