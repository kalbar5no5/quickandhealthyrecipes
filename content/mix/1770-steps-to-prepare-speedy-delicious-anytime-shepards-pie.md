Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
