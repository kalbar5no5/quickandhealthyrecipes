Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
