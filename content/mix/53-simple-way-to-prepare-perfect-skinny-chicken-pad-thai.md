Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
