Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
