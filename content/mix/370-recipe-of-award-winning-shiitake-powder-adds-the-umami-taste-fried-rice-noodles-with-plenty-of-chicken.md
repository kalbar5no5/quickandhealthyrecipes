That&#39;s a pizza and it&#39;s delicious. Chicken noodle soup is the same: onion, garlic, carrot, celery (glutamate) and chicken (inosinate). Although we like to think of taste as fully personal preference or more artistic… it&#39;s actually a little scientific. Season to taste with the soy sauce and add fresh cracked black pepper if desired.

Although we like to think of taste as fully personal preference or more artistic… it&#39;s actually a little scientific. Season to taste with the soy sauce and add fresh cracked black pepper if desired. Remove from the heat, add the cooked peas, and scallions - toss to fluff the rice up and serve immediately. To enhance the umami flavors ( our fifth taste sensation ) use Dashi broth instead of water when making rice! Add soy sauce to the dish. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
