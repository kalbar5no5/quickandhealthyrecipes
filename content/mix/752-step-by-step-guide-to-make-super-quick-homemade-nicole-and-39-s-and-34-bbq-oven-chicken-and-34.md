Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
