Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
