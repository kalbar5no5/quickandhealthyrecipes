Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
