Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
