Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
