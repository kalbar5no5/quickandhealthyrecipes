Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
