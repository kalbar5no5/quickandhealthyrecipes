Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
