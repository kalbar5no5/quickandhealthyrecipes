Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
