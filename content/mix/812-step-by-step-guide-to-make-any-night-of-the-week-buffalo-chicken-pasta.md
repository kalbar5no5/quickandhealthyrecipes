Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
