Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
