Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
