##### Instructions to make Miso Soup:

1. Hydrate the wakame seaweed by soaking in a little hot water. Chop the spring onions (you only need the greens) to garnish.
1. Gently heat the dashi stock and seaweed and hear gently for a few minutes. Stir in the miso paste but do not boil the liquid as it will destroy nutritional benefits and taste. We used brown rice miso, which has quite a strong but delicate flavour. Taste your stock and add more if required. Add the tofu and continue to heat for a minute.
1. Serve and garnish with spring onions. This is nice to start a meal or as a side dish with rice and vegetables.


To eat the solid ingredients in miso soup, the bowl is cradled in one hand, while chopsticks are used to. I&#39;ve had this miso soup in the queue for a little while now. Which isn&#39;t normally the way I work, but I knew this humble healthy soup would get little love in between all of the sparkly. Miso Soup is a classic Japanese dish that is typically served alongside a meal or enjoyed as a snack. Many miso soup ingredients are vegetables. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
