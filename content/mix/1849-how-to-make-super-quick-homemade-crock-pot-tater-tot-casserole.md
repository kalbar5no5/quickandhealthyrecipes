Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
