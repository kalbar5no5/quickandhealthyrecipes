Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
