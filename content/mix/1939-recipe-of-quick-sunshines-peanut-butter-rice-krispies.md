Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
