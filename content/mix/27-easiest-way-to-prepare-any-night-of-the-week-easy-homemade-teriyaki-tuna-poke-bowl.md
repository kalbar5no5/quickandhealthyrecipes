recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice thoroughly in a strainer or colander under the tap. Once the water that comes out of the rice is completely clean, you can start boiling the rice.

- "In a medium bowl, gently combine the tuna with soy sauce and sesame oil."
- "Slice the carrot into thin layers and slice up your shrimp sticks into small pieces."
- "Mix the shrimp with a little bit mayonnaise. Your shrimp salad is ready!"
- "Spoon the slightly cooled rice (rather a little warm, then cold) into bowls.  Divide the tuna, carrot slices, corns, edamame beans, and the shrimp salad on this."
- "Top the poke bowl with sesame seeds and possibly chili flakes and serve immediately."
- "Enjoy!"

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
