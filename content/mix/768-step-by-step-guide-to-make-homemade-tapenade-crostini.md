Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
