Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
