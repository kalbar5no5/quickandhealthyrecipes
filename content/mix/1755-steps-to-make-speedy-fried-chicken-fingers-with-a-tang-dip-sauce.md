Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
