Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
