Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
