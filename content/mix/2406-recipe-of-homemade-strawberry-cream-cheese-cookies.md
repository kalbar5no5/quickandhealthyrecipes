Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
