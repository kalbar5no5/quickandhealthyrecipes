Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
