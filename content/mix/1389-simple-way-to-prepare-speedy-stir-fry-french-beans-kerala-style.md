Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
