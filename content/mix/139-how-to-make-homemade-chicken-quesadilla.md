Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
