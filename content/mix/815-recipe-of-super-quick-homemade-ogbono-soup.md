Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
