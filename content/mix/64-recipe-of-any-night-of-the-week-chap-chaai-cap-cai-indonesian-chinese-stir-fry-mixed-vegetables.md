Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
