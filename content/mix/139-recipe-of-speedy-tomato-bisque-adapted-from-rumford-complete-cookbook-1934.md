Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
