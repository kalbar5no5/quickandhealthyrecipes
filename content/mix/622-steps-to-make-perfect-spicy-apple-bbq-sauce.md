Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
