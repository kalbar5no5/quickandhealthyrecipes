How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
