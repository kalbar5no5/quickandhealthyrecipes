Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
