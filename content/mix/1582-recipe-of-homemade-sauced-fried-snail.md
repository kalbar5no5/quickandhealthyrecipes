Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!
