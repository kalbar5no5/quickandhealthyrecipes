Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
