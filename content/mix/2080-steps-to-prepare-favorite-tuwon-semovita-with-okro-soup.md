Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
