Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
