Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
