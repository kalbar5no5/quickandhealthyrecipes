Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
