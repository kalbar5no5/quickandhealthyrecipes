Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
