Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
