It is used to make okonomiyaki. To the flour, you add your ingredients such as cabbage, egg and water to make your Okonomiyaki. In a large bowl, add okonomiyaki flour and stir in the dashi broth until the flour dissolves. Add cabbage, green onions and eggs to the batter and mix well. The three recipes had, without exception, too much flour and were more like a vegetable pancake (which Okonomiyaki is not, really.) The essense of Okonomiyaki is Dashi (Japanese Katsuo fish stock), and then Cabbage, Eggs and only just enough flour to hold it together. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
