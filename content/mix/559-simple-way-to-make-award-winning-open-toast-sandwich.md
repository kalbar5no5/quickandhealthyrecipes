Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
