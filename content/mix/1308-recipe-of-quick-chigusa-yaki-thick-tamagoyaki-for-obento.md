Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
