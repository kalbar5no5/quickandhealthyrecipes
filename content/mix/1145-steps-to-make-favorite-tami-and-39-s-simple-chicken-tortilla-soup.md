Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
