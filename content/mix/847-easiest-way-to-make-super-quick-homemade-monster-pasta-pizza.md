Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
