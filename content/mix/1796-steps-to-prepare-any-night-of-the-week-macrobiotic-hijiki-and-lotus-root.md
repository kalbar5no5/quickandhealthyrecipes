How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
