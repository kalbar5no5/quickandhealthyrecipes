Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
