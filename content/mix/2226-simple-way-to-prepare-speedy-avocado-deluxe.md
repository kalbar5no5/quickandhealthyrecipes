Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
