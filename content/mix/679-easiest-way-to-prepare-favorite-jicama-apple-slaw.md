Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
