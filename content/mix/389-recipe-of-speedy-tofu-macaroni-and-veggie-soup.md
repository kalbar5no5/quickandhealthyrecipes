Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
