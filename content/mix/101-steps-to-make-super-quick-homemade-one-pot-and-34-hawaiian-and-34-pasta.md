Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
