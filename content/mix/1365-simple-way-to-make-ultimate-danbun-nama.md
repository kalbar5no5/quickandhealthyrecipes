How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
