Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
