Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
