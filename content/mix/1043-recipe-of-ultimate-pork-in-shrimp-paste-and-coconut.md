Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
