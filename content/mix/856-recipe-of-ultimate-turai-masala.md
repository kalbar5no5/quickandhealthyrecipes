Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
