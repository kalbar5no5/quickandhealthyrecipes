Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
