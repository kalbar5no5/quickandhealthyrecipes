Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
