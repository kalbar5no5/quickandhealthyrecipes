recipeingredient:
- "2 small Egg"
- "50 ml Water or soup stock"
- "1 rounded tablespoon Sugar"
- "1 tsp Mirin"
- "1/2 tsp Sake"
- "1 dash over 18 teaspoon Salt"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients except the vegetable oil in a bowl and mix well with a whisk (mix until the egg whites are blended well, but do not to create bubbles)."
- "Strain the mixture with a sieve, and then strain again using a finer tea strainer. ※Mixing the mixture with a spoon while straining will speed up this process."
- "Thinly coat the frying pan with oil using a paper towel dipped in oil, and heat on medium heat."
- "When the frying pan is heated, pour in 1/3 of the egg mixture."
- "Gently scramble the egg when it starts to bubble, then roll it up when the egg is soft set. Remove the frying pan from the heat while rolling. Use a spatula to roll if it is difficult."
- "Using the same paper towel you used to coat the pan with oil, remove the excess egg from the pan while coating the pan with a new layer of oil. Pour half of the remaining egg mixture so that it flows beneath the already rolled egg."
- "Repeat the rolling process as before, add the remaining egg mixture and rolling while cooking (The egg should be rolled 3 times in total)."
- "The egg should be soft-set at this point."
- "Reduce the heat to low (to prevent burning) and cook the egg through while gently pressing down on the egg with a spatula. Then it&#39;s ready."
- "Addendum: Pressing the tamagoyaki to the side of the frying pan with the spatula will make a thick tamagoyaki without air pockets."
- "Addendum: Even if you have trouble rolling the eggs nicely and they become scrambled, just finish by pressing down on them and fry, then it should be be fine."
- "Addendum: If you turn off the fire, cover the pan with a lid and let the tamagoyaki steam cook, you can prevent the tamagoyaki from being undercooked."
- "Addendum: Straining the egg mixture will make the tamagoyaki smoother, but it should also be fine mixed with a whisk without straining. Don&#39;t bother straining the mixture if you don&#39;t have time."
- "The flavors will be more pronounced if you chill the tamagoyaki in the refrigerator after it cools down slightly. I recommend serving it chilled to a freshly made one."
- "Add bonito soup stock and a little salt and sugar instead of water when making a dashi-maki. Or you could use a stock made from 1/2 teaspoon powdered soup stock to 50 ml water."
- "Addendum: When making atsuyaki-tamago (thick tamagoyaki) with a doubled amount of ingredients, it will be easier to roll by repeating the pouring and rolling process several more times."
- "Addendum: If it burns easily, reduce the heat to low heat."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
