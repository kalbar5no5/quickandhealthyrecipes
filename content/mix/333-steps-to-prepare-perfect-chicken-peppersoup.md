Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
