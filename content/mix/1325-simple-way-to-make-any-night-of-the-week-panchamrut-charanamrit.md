Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
