It&#39;s very dense with shredded chicken, so I&#39;ve been using it for sandwiches and even just eating it straight, but Buffalo sauce is a very strong flavor to have just on it&#39;s own over and over. Throw it in the microwave for a couple seconds. Add cream cheese, canned or cooked chicken (shredded or chunks for a more thick dip). Add your ranch, cheese and buffalo sauce.

Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
