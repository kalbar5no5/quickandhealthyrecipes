Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
