Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
