Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
