Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
