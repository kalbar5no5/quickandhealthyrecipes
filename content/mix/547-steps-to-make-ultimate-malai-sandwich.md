Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
