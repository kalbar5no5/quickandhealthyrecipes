Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them.
