Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
