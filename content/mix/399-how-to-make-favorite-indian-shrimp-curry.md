Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
