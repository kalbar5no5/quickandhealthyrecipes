- " At least 1 tsp pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel all the skin off potatoes and chop into bite sized pieces. (About 1 inch)."
- "Remove husk from corn and clean very well. Remove any bad spots. Over a large bowl use a knife to remove kernels from the cob. Then, take a spoon and &#39;milk&#39; the cob, removing all of the kernel bits and juice from the cob. I save one cob and milk it at the very end as a garnish."
- "In a Dutch oven, brown the bacon. Leave 1/4 of grease rendered in pot, set the rest aside. Set bacon on napkin to absorb grease and use as topping for end result."
- "Melt butter in pot with the bacon grease. Add onion and celery. Season with a little bit of your salt and pepper. Saute for a few minutes or until onion is translucent and flavors are brought out. You can smell when this has happened."
- "Add your carrots, garlic and the rest of your seasonings (except for chicken bullion). Saute for 2 minutes."
- "Add potatoes and corn to pot. Fill with water about 1 inch above ingredients. Cover and bring to a boil. Add cream and chicken bullion and stir. Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender."
- "Use an immersion blender or hand potato masher and blend 1/3 of potatoes to thicken broth. If you like a thicker chowder you can mix 2 tsp of cornstarch with some cold water and add to pot. Allow to simmer 10 more minutes and serve."
- "I garnish mine with fresh pulp from one corn, parmesan cheese and the bacon bits."

Reviews for: Photos of Cheesy Potato and Corn Chowder. At the last minute I threw in some shredded chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (it still would have been good without that) I also used Yukon Gold potatoes in this recipe. Stir in flour and gently toss to combine. I love potato soup and corn chowder so this combo sounds lovely to me!

Stir in flour and gently toss to combine. I love potato soup and corn chowder so this combo sounds lovely to me! Corn Chowder with Ham and Potatoes. Growing up we ate a lot of potato soup. My mom would make it either with ham (when we had a left over roast) or with hot dogs. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
