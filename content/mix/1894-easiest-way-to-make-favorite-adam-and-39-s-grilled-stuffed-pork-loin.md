Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
