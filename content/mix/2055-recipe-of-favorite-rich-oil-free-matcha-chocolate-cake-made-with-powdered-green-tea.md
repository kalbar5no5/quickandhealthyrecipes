Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
