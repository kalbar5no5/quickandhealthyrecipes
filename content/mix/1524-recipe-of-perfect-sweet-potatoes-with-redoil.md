Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
