Unlike the standard roasted turkey, the bird is prepared two ways here. The breast of the honey-rosemary brined turkey is slow-cooked in a sous vide for a fork-tender texture, while the leg is done confit style.

Unlike the standard roasted turkey, the bird is prepared two ways here. The breast of the honey-rosemary brined turkey is slow-cooked in a sous vide for a fork-tender texture, while the leg is done confit style. Accompanying the turkey are sides of roasted vegetables, pine nut-sage and onion bread stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy. This is a traditional stew called Chikzen-ni, and is often served in a Japanese New Year meal, and one of my favorite New Year dishes since I was a child. The root vegetables such as burdock, lotus, carrot and sato-imo (taro) are cooked with konnyaku (yam jelly), dry shiitake, and chicken in dashi, and seasoned with soy sauce and black sugar. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
