Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
