Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
