Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
