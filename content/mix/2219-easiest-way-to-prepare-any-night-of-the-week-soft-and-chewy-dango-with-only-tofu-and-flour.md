Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
