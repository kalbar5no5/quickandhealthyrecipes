Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
