How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
