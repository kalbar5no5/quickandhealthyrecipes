Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
