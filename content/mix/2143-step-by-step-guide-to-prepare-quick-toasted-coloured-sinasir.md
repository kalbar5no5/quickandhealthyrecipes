If you wait until they are very toasted in the pan, they will become burnt and bitter once off the heat. Process them in a blender or food processor until finely ground (or a mortar and pestle). Delicate toasted whole spices like cumin, caraway, and fennel can be eaten whole and add texture to a dish. Whole toasted cumin seeds sprinkled over a rice pilaf, for example, adds visual appeal, a touch of crunch, and is not overwhelming to spice-phobic taste buds.

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
