Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
