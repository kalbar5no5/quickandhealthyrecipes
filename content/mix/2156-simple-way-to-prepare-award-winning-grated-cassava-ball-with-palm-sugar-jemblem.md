Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
