Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
