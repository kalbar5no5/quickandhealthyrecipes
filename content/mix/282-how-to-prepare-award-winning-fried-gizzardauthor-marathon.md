Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
