Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
