Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
