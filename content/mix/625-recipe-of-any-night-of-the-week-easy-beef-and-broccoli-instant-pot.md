Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
