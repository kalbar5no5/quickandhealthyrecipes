Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
