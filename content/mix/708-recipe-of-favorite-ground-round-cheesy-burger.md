Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
