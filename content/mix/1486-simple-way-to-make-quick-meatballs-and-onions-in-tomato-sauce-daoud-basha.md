Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
