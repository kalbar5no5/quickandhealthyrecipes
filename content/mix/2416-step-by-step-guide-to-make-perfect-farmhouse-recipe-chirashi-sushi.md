Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
