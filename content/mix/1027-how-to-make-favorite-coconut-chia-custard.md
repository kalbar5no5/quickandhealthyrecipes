Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
