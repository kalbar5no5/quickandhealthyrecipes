Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
