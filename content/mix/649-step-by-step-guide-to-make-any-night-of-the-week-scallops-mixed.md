Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
