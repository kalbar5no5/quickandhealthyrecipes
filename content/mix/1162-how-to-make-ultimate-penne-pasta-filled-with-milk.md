Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
