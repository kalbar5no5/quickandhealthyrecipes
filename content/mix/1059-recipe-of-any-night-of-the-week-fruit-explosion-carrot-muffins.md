How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
