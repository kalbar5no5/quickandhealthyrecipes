Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
