Transfer the baked bars to a cooling rack and immediately brush on the glaze with a pastry brush; let the glaze soak into the bars somewhat before applying another layer. The cinnamon flavor is just right, and with the use of mostly brown sugar, these cookies have a subtle caramel flavor that pairs perfectly with the cinnamon apples.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
