Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
