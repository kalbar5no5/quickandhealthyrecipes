Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
