Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
