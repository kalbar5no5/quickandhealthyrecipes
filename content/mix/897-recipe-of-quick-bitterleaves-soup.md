Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
