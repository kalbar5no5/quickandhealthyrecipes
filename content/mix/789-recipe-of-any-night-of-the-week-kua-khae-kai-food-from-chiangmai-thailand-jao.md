Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
