Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
