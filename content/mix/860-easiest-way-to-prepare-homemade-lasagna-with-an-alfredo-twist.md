Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
