Add the sausages, then add the tomatoes, stock, herbs, salt and pepper. Add the beans to the soup and bring back to a simmer. Take the sausage meat out of the casings and crumble it into a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Drain a bit of the fat, leaving some in for flavor. I prep as I go along, so I chop the onion and get the other ingredients started as the sausage cooks. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
