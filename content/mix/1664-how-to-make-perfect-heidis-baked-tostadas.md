Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
