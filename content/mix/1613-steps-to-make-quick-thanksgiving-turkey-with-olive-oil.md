Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
