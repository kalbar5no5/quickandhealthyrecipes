Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
