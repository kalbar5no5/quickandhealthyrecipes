Best week night dinner right here! Add the tom yum paste, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and chillies and cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Add the cherry tomatoes (I put them in whole but I&#39;d suggest halving them for quicker cooking), mushrooms and tomato paste. Fry until the tomatoes make a thick sauce with the mushrooms and paste.

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
