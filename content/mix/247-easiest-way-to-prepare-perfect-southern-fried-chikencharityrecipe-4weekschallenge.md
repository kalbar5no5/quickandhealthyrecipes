Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
