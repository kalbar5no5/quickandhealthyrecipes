Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
