Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
