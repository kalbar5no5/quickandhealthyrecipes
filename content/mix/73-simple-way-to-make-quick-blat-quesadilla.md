Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
