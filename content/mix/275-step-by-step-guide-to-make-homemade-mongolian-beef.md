Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
