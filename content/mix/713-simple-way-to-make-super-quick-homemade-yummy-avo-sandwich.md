Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
