Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
