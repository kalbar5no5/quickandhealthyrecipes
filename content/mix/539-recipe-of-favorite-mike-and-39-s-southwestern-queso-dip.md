Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
