Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
