Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
