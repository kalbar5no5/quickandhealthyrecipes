Place the slices in a sauté pan, add a little of the liquid, and cover it. It only takes a few minutes to create steam, and you&#39;re ready to eat. Okay, I&#39;m cheating and throwing in a sandwich, but only because this recipe&#39;s focus is entirely on the apple. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
