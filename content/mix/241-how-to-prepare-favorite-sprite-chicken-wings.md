Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
