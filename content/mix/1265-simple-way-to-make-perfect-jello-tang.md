Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
