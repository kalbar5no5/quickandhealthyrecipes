Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
