Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
