Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
