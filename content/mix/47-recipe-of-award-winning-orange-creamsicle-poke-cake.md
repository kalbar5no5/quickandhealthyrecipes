Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
