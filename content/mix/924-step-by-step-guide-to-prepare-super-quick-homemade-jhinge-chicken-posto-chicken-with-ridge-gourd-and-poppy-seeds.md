How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
