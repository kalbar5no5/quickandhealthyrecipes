Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
