Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
