Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
