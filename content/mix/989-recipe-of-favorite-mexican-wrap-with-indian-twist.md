Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
