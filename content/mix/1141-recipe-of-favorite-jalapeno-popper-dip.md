Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
