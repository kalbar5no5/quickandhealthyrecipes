Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
