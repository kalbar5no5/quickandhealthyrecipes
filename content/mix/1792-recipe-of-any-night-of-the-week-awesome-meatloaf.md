Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
