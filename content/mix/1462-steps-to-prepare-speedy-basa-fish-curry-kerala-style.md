Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
