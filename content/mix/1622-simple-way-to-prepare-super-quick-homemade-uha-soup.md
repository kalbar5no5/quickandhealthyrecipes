Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
