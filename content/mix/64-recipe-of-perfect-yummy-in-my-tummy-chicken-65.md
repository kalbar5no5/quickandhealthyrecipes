Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
