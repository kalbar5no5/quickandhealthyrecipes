How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
