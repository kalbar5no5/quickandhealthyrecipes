Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
