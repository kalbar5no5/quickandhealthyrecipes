Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
