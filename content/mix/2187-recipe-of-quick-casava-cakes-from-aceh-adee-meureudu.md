Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
