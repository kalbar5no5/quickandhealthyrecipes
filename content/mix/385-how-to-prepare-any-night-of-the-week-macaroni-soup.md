Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
