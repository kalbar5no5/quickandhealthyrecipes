Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
