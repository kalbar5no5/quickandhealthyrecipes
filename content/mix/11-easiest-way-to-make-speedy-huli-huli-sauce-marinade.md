Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
