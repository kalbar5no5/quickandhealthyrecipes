Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
