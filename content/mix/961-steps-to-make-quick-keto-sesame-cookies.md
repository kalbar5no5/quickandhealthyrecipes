Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
