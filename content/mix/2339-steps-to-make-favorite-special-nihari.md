How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
