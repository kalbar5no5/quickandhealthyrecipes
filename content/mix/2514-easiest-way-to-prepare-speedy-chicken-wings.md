Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
