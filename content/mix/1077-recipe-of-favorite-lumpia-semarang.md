How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
