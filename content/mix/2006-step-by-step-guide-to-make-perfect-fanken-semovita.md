Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
