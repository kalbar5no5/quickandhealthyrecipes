Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
