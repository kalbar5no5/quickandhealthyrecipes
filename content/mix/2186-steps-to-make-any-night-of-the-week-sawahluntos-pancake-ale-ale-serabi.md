How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
