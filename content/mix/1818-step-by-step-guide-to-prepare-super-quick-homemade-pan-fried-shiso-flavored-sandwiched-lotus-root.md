Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
