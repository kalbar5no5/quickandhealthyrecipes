Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
