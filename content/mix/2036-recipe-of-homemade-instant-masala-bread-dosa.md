Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
