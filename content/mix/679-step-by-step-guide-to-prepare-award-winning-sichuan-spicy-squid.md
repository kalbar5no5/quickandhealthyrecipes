Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
