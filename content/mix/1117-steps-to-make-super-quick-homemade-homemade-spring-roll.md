How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
