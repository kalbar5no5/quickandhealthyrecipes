Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
