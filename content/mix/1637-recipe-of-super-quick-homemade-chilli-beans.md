If your chili doesn&#39;t have beans it&#39;s not outlaw chili. Garnish with lime, cilantro, diced onions, Cheddar cheese, and diced avocado. I found a recipe for Taco soup that calls for Chili Beans. The can I found at the grocery store has chemicals I am not allowed to eat. Can I make homemade Chili Beans with my own beans and seasonings? 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
