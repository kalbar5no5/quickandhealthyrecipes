Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
