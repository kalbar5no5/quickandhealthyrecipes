Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
