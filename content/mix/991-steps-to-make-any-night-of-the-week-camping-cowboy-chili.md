Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
