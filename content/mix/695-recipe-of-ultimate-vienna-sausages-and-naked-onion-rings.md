Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
