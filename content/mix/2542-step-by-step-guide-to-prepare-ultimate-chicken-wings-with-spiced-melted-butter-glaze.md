Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
