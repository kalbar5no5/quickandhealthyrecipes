Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
