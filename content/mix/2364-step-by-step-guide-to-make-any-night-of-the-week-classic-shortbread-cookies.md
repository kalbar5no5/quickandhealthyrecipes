Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
