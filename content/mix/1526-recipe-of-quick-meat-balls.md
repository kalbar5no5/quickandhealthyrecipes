Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
