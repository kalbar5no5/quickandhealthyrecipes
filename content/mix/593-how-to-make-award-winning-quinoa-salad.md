Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
