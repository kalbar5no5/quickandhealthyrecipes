Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
