Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, asparagus-stuffed chikuwa fish paste sticks. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Asparagus-Stuffed Chikuwa Fish Paste Sticks is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes delicious. Asparagus-Stuffed Chikuwa Fish Paste Sticks is something that I have loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

Chikuwa is fishcake shaped into sticks or tubes that are long and hollow inside, and it is the most often used meat used in Isobeage. Other seafood like fish and shrimp or even chicken are also suitable for the dish. This is very flexible side dish that you can adjust to your taste and what you have available. Chikuwa *OR Fish Balls • Note: Chikuwa is a tube-shape Japanese fishcake.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have asparagus-stuffed chikuwa fish paste sticks using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Asparagus-Stuffed Chikuwa Fish Paste Sticks:

1. Prepare 1 stalk Asparagus
1. Prepare 2 stick Chikuwa
1. Get 1 Mayonnaise
1. Prepare 1 Black pepper (I recommend coarsely ground)
1. Get 1 Soy sauce


Chikuwa may not have name recognition overseas, but the tube-shaped fish paste cake is beloved throughout Japan and commonly made in coastal areas. Like the American hot dog, however, chikuwa is a staple that is widely consumed but not well understood, or at the very least bought commercially and not considered a home-cooked dish. Once the fish cake is formed, it needs to rest for an hour before cooking. It&#39;s apparently a step that gives it the right mouthfeel/chewy - not sure of the science involved, but I guess it&#39;s about the starch.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
