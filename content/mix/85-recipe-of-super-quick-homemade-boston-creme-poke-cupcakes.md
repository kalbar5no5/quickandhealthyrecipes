Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
