How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
