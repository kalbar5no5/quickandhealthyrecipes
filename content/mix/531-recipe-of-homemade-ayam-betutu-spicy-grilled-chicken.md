Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
