How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
