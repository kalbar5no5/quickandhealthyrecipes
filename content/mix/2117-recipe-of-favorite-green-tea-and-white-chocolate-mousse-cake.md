- "Add the mixture from Step 19 to the cream from  Step 16 (150 ml) and mix well."
- "Add the egg white (whipped) from Step 15 to the mixture from Step 20. Mix it well but do not break the foamy texture of the whipped egg white."
- "Pour the mousse on top of the sponge cake from Step 13, smooth out the surface and chill in the refrigerator."
- "For the matcha mousse. Soak gelatin in water."
- "Add egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and whip until it becomes thick and white."

- "Pour the green tea mixture from Step 28 into the mold with the chilled mousse from Step 22 and chill for another 2 hours in the refrigerator until it is set."
- "Once the mousse is set, sift matcha on top with a tea strainer to decorate."
- "Removing the cake from its mold will be easier if you wrap the mold with a warm and wet towel."
- "Here I sliced a 19.5 cm square sponge cake into two pieces, and then used a 5.5 cm cake ring to cut them again into this shape. I also used mousse film around the cake to hold it together. When you cut it out like this, you get 13 portions."

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
