Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
