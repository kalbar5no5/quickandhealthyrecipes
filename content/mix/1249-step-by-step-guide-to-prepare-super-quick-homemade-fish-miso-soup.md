Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
