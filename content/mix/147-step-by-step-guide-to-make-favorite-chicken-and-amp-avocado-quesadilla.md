Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
