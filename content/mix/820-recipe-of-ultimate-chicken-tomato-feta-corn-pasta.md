Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
