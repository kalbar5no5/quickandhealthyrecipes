Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
