Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
