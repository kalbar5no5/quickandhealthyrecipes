Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
