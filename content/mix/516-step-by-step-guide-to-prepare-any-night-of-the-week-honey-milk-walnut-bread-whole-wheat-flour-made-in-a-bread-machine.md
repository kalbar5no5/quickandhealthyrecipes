Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
