Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
