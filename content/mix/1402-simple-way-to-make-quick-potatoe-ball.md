Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!
