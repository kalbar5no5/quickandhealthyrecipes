Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
