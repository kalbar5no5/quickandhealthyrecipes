Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
