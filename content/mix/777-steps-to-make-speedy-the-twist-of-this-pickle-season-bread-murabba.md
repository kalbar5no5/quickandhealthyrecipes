Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
