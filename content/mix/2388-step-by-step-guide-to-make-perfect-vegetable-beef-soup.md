Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
