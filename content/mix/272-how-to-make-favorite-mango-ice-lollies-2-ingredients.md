How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
