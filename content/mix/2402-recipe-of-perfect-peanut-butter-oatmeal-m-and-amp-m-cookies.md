The peanut butter also gave the oatmeal a wonderful creamy consistency which I loved! However it was slightly on the bland side not terribly bland but bland enough that I will have to tweak the recipe. Possibly add raisins cinnamon maybe add more maple syrup or walnuts. Peanut butter is packed with mono and poly unsaturated fats, which regulate glucose levels, reduce heart disease risk, and support healthy hormone I do this too! A small banana and a tablespoon of peanut butter makes for some seriously delicious oatmeal. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
