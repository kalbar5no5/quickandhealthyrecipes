Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
