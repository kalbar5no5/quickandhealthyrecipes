Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
