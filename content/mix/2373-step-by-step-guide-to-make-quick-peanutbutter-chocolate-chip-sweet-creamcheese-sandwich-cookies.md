How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
