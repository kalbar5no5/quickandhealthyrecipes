Curry powders are a combination of dried spices blended together often used in Indian cooking. Many store-bought curry powders are made with very old spices that have essentially turned to sawdust. There are a hundred different ways to cook chicken curry, but Bengalis (from the eastern part of India) make something called Kosha (or kawshaa) which is very good with either rice or any kind of flat bread. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
