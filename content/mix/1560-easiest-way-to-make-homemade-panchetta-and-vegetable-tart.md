Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
