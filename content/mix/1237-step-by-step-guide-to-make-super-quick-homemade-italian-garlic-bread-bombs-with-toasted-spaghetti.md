Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
