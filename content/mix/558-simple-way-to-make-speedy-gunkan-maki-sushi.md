How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
