recipeinstructions:

- "Cut the satoimi into hexagonal shapes, and blanch quickly. Wash them off to remove the surface sliminess and drain in a colander."

- "Shiitake mushrooms: Quickly rinse off any dirt, take off the stems, and cut in half if they are big. (Dried shiitake mushrooms are delicious, too.)"
- "Konnyaku: Slice 7 to 8 mm thick, make a slit down the middle, push the ends into the slit so they twist to form a knot konnyaku (see photo). Blanch in boiling water. (This prevents the konnyaku from un-twisting.)"
- "Put some oil in a pot and stir fry the chicken quickly. When it browns, remove."
- "Add some oil to the same pot and quickly stir fry the ingredients from Steps 2 to 7. Add the ★ ingredients, put on a small lid that sits on top of the pot contents (drop lid or otoshibuta) and simmer over medium heat until the ingredients are tender."
- "While the pot is simmering, prepare the decorative snow peas. Take the strings off, and blanch quickly in salted water (the salt is not included in the ingredient list). Refresh in cold water to fix the color. Cut as shown in the photo (or in any way you prefer)."
- "When the vegetables from Step 9 have cooked through, add the ◆ flavoring ingredients and chicken, and simmer until almost no liquid is left in the pan. (Cover partially with a lid and shake the pan around occasionally to distribute the flavors.)"
- "Transfer to a serving plate, and decorate with the snow peas. Serve."
- "How to cut the flower-shaped lotus root"
- "Make cuts from the skin side in between all the holes of the lotus root."
- "Cut around each hole while peeling. When all the edges above the holes have been cut on one side, flip over and cut off the remaining peel to finish."
- "How to cut nejiri-ume (twisted ume flowers)."

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
