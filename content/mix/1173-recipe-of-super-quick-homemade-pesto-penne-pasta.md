Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
