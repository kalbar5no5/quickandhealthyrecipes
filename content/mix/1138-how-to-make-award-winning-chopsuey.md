Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body.
