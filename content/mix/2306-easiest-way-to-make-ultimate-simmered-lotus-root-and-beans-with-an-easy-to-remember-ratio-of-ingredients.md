Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
