Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
