Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
