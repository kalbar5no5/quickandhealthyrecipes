Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
