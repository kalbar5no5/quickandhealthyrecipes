Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
