Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
