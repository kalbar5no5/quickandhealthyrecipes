I always double the sauce recipe to have extra on the side for dipping. Grease a baking dish with cooking spray. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Add remaining barbecue sauce on top and cover with plastic wrap. Put chicken in the crock pot and pour sauce mixture over it. (I usually save some sauce to drizzle over the chicken when I serve it). 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
