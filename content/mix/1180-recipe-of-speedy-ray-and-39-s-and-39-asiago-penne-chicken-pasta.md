Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
