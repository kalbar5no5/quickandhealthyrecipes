Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
