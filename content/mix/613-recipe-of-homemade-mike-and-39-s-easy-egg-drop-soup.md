Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
