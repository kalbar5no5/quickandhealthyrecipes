Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
