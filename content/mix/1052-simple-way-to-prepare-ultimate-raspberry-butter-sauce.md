Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
