How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
