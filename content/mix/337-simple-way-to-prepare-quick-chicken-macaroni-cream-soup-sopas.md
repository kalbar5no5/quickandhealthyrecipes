Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
