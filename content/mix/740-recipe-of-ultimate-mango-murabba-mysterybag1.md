Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
