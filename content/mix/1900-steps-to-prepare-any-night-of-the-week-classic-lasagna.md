Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
