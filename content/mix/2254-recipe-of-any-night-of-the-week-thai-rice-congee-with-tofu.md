Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
