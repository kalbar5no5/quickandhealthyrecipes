Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
