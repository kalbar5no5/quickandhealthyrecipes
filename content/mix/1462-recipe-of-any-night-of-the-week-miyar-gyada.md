Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
