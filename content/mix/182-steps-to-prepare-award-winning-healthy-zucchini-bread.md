Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
