Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
