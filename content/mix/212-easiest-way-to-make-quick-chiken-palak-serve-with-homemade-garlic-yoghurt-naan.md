Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
