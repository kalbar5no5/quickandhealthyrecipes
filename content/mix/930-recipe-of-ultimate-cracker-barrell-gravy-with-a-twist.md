Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
