Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
