Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
