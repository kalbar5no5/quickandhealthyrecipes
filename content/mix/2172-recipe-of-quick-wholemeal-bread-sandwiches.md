Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
