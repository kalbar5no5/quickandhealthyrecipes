Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
