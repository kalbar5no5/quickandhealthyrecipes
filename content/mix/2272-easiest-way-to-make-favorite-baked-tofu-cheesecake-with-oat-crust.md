recipeingredient:
- " Oat Crust"
- "75 g (1/2 cup) all purpose flour"
- "45 g (1/2 cup) oat flour make your own by grinding rolled oats"
- "2 Tbsp almond flour make your own by grinding almonds"
- "2 Tbsp dark brown sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) butter melted"
- "2 Tbsp honey or maple syrup"
- " Filling"
- "300 g soft tofu 1 rectangular tube"
- "300 g (1 cup) neufchtel or cream cheese"
- "100 g (1/2 cup) plain yoghurt preferably greek yoghurt"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) butter melted"
- "100 g (1/2 cup) icing sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 Tbsp cornstarch"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/8 tsp salt"
- " Zest and juice of a lemon if you like lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Take the block of neufchâtel out of its box and let it warm on the counter while you prepare the crust, about 30 minutes."
- "Cut a large piece of foil and lay it on your work surface. Set the cake tin (i use 9x9 inch cake tin) in the middle and fold the edges of the foil up around the sides of the tin. The foil gives you extra protection against water getting into the pan during the water bath step."
- "Blend all the ingredients for the crust with a food processor. Press the mixture into the cake tin."
- "Place the crust in the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the crust is fragrant and just starting to brown around the edges. Let the crust cool on a cooling rack while you prepare the filling."
- "Blend all the ingredients for the filling with a food processor until smooth and creamy."
- "Check to make sure the crust and the sides of the pan are cool — if they&#39;re cool enough to comfortably touch, you can go on. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and spread it into an even layer against the sides of the pan."
- "Transfer the cake tin to a roasting pan or other baking dish big enough to hold it. Bring a few cups of water to a boil and pour the water into the roasting pan, being careful not to splash any water onto the cheesecake. Fill the pan to about an inch."
- "Bake the cheesecake at 350°F for 25 to 35 minutes. The cheesecake is done when the outer two to three inches look slightly puffed and set, but the inner circle still jiggles (like Jell-o) when you gently shake the pan."
- "Turn off the oven and crack the door open. Let the cheesecake cool slowly for one hour."
- "Chill the cheesecake, uncovered, for at least four hours or up to three days in the refrigerator. This step is crucial for letting the cheesecake set and achieving perfect cheesecake texture — don&#39;t rush it."
- "Serve the cheesecake cool, plain or with some fruits or preserves."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
