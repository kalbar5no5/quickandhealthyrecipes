This is a hearty grilled sandwich with a distinctive and delicious combination of ingredients. The pickle slices add a bit of fun, and the barbecue sauce provides a hint of sweetness that&#39;s irresistible. â€”Henry Mujica, North Riverside, Illinois The sharp cheddar is a staple in many sandwiches; in this lineup, it helps provide a bit of tanginess. To balance the cheddar, Josh recommends Monterey jack. Its mellow flavor is a lot like mozzarella, plus it gives the sandwich that &#34;much-desired stringy, cheese-pull effect many of us look forward to when eating a grilled cheese sandwich. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
