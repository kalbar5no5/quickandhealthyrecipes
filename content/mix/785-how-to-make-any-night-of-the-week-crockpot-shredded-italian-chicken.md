Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
