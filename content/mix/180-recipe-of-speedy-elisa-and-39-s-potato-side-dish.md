Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
