Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
