Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
