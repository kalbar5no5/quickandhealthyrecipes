Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
