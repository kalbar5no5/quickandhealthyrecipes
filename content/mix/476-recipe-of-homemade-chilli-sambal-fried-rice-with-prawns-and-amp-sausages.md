How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
