Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
