Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
