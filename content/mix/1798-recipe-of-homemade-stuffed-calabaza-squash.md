Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
