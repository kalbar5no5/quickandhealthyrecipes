Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
