Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
