Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
