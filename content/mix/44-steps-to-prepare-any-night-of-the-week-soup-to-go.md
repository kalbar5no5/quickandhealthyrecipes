Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
