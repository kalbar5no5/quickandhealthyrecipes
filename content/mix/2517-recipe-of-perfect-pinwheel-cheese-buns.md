Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
