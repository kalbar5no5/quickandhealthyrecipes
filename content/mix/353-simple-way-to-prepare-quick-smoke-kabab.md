Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
