Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
