Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
