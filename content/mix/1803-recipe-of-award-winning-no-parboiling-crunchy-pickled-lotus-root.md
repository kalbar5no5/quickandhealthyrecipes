Lotus roots — especially the younger and more tender ones — are sometimes served pickled in salads. When cooking lotus root, it is helpful to have some water on hand to which a little lemon juice or vinegar has been added. Submerging the peeled and sliced lotus root in water containing acid will prevent discoloration. Bring water to boil in a sauce pan and add lotus root.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
