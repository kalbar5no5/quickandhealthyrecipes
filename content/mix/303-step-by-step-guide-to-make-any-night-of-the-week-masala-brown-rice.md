Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
