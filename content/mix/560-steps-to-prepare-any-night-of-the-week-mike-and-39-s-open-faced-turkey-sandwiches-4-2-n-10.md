Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
