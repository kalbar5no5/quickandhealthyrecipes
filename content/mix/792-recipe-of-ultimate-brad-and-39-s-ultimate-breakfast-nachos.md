Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
