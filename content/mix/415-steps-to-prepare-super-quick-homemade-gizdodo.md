Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
