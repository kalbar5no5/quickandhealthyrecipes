Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
