How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
