Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
