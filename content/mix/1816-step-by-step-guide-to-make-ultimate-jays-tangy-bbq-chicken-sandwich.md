Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
