Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
