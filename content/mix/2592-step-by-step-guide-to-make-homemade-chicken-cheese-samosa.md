Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
