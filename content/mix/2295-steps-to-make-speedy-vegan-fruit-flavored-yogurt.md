Yogurt has been the one thing I have REALLY missed since going vegan. I used to eat yogurt by the container and put it on e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. I also loved to make homemade yogurt at home every week. Over the years, I slowly adapted the recipe to make it Plus, if you use vanilla protein powder it adds a touch more sweetness and flavour.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
