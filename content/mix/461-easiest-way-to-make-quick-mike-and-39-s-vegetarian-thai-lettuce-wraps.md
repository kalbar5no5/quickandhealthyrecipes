Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
