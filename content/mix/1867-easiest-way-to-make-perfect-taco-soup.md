Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
