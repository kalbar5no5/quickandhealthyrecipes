Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
