How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
