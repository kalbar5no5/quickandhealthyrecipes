Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
