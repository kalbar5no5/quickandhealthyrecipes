How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
