Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
