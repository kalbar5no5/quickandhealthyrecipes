Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
