Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
