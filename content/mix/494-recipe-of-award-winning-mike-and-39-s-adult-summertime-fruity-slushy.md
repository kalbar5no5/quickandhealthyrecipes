Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
