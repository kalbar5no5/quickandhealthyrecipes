How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
