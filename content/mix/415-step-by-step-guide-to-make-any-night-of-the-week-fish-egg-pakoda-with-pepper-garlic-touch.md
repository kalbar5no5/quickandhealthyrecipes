Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
