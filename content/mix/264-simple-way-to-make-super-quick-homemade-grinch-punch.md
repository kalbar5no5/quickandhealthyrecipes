Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
