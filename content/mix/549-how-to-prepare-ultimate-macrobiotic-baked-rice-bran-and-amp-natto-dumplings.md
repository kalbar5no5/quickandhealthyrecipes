I am constantly searching for ways to improve our gluten-free baked goods and flour mixes at Outrageous Baking Company. My staff and I search for the highest quality ingredients so you can imagine my delight when I came across a non-genetically modified rice bran oil that works beautifully in our baked goods. The deep black or purple color of black rice&#39;s outer layer - the bran and hull- contains a powerful antioxidant called anthocyanin. The level of anthocyanin contained in black rice is higher than any other grain, including brown rice, red rice, red quinoa, or other colored whole grain varieties.

Rice bran oil also allegedly contains chemicals that are beneficial to health. Place the rice, milk, cinnamon, maple syrup, and dried cranberries in a bowl and mix everything together. Serve with extra fruit and some walnuts or almonds on the side. **Note: You can also heat the rice pudding in the microwave to serve as a hot breakfast. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
