Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
