Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel).

DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
