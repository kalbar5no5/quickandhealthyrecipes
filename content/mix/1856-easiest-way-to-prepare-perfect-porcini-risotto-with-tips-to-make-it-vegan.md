- "1.5 glass dried porcini mushrooms"
- "1 cup dry white wine"
- " Butter"
- " Grated Parmesan"
- "1 shallot"
- "2 stock cubes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by putting the porcini mushrooms in hot water for about 15 minutes at least. When they are ready pull them out of the water and pass through your fingers making sure that there are no dirt residues on them. Chop them into pieces"
- "Make the broth by putting about 1l of water in a pan with 2 vegetable stock cubes and bring to boil. Once boiled reduced the heat to low"
- "Take a large pan and add some butter let it melt and when it starts to foam add the mushrooms, cook on medium heat for a a few minutes and remove them from the pan. For vegan option skip the butter and use olive oil instead"
- "Add a bit more butter and cook the onion chopped into thin pieces. Cook on slow heat and with a pinch of salt until golden. If the pan gets too hot and the onion starts to turn brown add a few tablespoons of broth to bring down the heat of the pan."
- "Add the rice and mix gently for a few minutes. The rice might start to stick slightly but that’s ok. When the rice goes from transparent to white and starts to stick to the pan add a drop of white wine. And mix well. Let evaporate and when it sticks add the remaining wine."
- "Now we start to add the stock a little bit at the time. You don’t need to wait until each ladle of stock has evaporated you just top it up when it starts to dry out. Continue to do this and mix in the rice gently for around 15 minutes. You will see the rice expand over the time"
- "Now the rice should have about 5 minutes left, add the mushrooms back in and add small amount of stock at the time. When you try the rice and it feels done although still has a bite to it turn off the heat."
- "Add a couple of spoons of butter and a handful of grated Parmesan. Mix it together and cover for 2-3 minutes. This step is called ‘mantecatura’ and it’s what makes the creaminess of the risotto (not cream!). I have tried with fake ‘Parmesan’ made from coconut as a vegan option and it also works"
- "Serve on a plate (not a bowl) and sprinkle with some parsley if you have it."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
