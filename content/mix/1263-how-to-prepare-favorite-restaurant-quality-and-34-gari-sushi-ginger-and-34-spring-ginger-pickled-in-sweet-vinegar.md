Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
