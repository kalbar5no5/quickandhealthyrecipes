Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
