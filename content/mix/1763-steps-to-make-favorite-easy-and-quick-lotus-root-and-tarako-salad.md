Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
