Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
