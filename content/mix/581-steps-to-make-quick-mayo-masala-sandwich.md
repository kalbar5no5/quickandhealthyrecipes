How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
