Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
