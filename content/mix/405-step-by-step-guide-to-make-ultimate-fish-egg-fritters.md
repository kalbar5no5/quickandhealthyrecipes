Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
