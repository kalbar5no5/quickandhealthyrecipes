The gizzard, also referred to as the ventriculus, gastric mill, and gigerium, is an organ found in the digestive tract of some animals, including archosaurs (pterosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, dinosaurs including birds), earthworms, some gastropods, some fish, and some crustaceans.

Gizzard is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look wonderful. Gizzard is something which I have loved my entire life.

A gizzard is a muscle found in the digestive tract of a chicken. If you&#39;ve ever seen chickens pecking away at the ground, they are in fact swallowing tiny bits of grit and gravel, which travels through the chicken&#39;s digestive tract and eventually lodges in the gizzard. Combining the pulsations of the gizzard with accumulated grit and food acts as a grinding mechanism. Once an optimal consistency is reached, the food is transported to the stomach for further digestion.

Combining the pulsations of the gizzard with accumulated grit and food acts as a grinding mechanism. Once an optimal consistency is reached, the food is transported to the stomach for further digestion. Chicken gizzards come with a taste that is similar to dark chicken meat. I make chicken gizzards and hearts all the time, and this recipe was simple but not alot of flavor. I boil mine for a few minutes, then throw them into a plastic bag with flour and Johnny&#39;s Seasoning salt, and black pepper. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
