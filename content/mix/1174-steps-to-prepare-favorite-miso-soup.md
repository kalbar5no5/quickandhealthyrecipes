Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
