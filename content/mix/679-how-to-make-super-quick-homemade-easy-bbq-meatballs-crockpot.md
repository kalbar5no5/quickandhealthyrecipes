Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
