Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
