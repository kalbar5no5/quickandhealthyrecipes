Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
