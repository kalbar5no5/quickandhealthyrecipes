Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
