Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
