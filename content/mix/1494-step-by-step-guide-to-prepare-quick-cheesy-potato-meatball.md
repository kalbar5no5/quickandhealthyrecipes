Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
