Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
