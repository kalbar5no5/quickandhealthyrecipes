Paniyaram is a popular south Indian breakfast dish usually made with leftover idli or dosa batter. Here I have made it with a blend of rice with chana dal (Bengal gram) and urad dal (skinned and split black gram). Kuzhi Paniyaram is basically a popular South Indian breakfast dish. It is generally made using the left over Idly Dosa batter in a cast iron paniyaram pan.

Kuzhi Paniyaram is basically a popular South Indian breakfast dish. It is generally made using the left over Idly Dosa batter in a cast iron paniyaram pan. But my mom never made them using left over idly batter , she always made the batter for Paniyaram from scratch and it had chana dal along with rice. Take paniyaram batter in a bowl, all the ingredients &amp; mix well. Heat paniyaram tawa (Iron casting tastes better than other material) &amp; grease with oil then pour batter. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
