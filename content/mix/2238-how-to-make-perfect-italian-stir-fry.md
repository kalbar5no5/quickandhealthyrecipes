Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
