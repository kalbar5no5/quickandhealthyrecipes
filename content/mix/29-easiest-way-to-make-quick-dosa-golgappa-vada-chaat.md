How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
