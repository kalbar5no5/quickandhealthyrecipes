Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
