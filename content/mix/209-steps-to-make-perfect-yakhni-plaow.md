Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
