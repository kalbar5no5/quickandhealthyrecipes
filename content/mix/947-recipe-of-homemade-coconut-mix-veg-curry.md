Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
