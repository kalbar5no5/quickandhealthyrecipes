Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
