Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
