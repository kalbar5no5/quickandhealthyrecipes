Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels.

Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine.
