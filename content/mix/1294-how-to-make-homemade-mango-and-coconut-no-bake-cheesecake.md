recipeinstructions:
- "Line the bottom of the springform pan with the sponge cake. Combine the sugar and water and heat in the microwave to dissolve. Add the liqueur to make a syrup and brush the syrup generously on the sponge cake."
- "Make the cheese filling. Mix the water and liqueur together, sprinkle with the gelatin powder and leave to soak."
- "Strain the mango to make a puree, firmly pressing it through the strainer with a spatula."
- "Put the cream cheese, which has been softened a bit in the microwave, and the sugar in a bowl and cream well with a spatula. When it&#39;s well combined, switch to a whisk and mix well."
- "Heat the mango puree and milk in a small saucepan until nearly boiling. Remove from heat, add the coconut milk powder and mix well until it&#39;s dissolved."
- "Dissolve the gelatin in Step 2 over hot water and stir it in to the mixture in Step 5. When it&#39;s well combined, cool the bottom of the pan in ice water while stirring thoroughly, until it no longer feels warm."
- "Whisk in the cream cheese mixture from Step 4, a little at a time, mixing well."

- "When the mixture in Step 9 has firmly set, cover the top evenly with the balls of mango."
- "Pour the jello liquid from Step 12 over the mango to coat. Chill again in the refrigerator until set."
- "Since I used easy-to-make proportions for the jelly sauce, you&#39;ll probably have a bit left over. Remove the cheesecake carefully from the pan when it&#39;s set, and it&#39;s done."
- "You can probably use canned mango in syrup instead of fresh. Adjust the amount of sugar in that case."
- "Since you can&#39;t make mango balls with canned mango, drain the mango well and cut it into slices to lay on top."

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
