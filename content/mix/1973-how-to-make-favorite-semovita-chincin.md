Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
