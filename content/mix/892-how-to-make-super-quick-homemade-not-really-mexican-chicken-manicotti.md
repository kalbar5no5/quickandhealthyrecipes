Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
