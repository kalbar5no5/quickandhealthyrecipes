It doesn&#39;t use mincemeat mixes or prepared pie crusts. It&#39;s homemade, like ma (or grandma) used to make. I made it for my father for Father&#39;s Day (he loves mince pie). Since my last meat pie recipe (which I admit was a bit standardâ€¦ still great, but not a knock out), I have been toiling in the kitchen to achieve the best fail-proof meat pie recipe with the most delicate, flaky meat pie crust which still stays whole and stable in your hand. My personal requirements for perfection are: A stable meat pie crust. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
