Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
