Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
