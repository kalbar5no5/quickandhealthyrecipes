Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
