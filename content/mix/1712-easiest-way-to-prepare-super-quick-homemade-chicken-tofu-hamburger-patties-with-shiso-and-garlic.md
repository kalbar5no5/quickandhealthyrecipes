Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
