Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
