Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
