Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
