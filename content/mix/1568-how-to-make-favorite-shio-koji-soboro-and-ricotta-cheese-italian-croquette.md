It is a quite fun to squeeze the potatoes with your hand. Keep the shio-koji soboro in your freezer to make different dishes. I plan to press and age it to see what happens. Mash it all up and store it in a container with plastic wrap against the ricotta refrigerated for at least a month. Shortly after, I started a batch of peanut butter miso. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
