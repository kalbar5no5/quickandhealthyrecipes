Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
