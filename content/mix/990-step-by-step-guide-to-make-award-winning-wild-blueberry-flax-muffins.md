Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
