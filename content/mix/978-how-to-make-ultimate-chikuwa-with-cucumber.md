Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
