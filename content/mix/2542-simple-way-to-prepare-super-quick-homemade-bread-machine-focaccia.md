Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
