Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
