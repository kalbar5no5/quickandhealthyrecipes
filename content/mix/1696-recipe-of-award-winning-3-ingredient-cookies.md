They are light, fluffy and thick, rich cookie that has the perfect peanut butter balance. Once they are cooked golden brown in oven enjoy warm with a cold glass of milk. Made with peanut butter and oatmeal, it can be made with or without the banana and is the perfect quick and easy breakfast! I REALLY love using a European style butter in this recipe, as the fat content is slightly higher, meaning it will be that much more rich and flavorful. These unbelievably easy -- and gluten-free -- cookies have only three ingredients and are a great way to use up those extra mixed nuts hanging out in. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
