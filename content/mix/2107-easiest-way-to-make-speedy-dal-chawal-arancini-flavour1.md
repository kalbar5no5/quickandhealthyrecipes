Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
