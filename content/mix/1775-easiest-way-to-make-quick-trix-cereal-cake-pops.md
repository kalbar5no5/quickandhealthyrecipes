Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
