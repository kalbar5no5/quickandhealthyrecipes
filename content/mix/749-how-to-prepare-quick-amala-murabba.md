Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
