Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
