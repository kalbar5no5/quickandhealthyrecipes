Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
