Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
