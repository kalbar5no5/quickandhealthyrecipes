Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
