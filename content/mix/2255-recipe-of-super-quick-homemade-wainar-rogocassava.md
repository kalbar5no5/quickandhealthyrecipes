Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
