How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
