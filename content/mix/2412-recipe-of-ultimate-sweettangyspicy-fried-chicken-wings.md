recipeingredient:
- " For the chicken"
- "3.5 pounds chicken wings"
- "1.5 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "3 Tablespoons corn starch"
- "4 cups frying oil I like soybean which is often labeled vegetable or peanut oil"
- " For the glaze"
- "3 Tablespoons oil"
- "2/3 cup minced onion"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic"
- "1/3 cup fruit jam you can use plum grape strawberry apricot or orange marmalade"
- "2 Tablespoons brown sugar"
- "2 Tablespoons soy sauce"
- "1/2 teaspoon fish sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar"
- "1 Tablespoon sriracha"
- "1 green onion chopped"
- " crushed red chili flakes for extra heat"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season chicken with salt and pepper, turning and massaging gently a few times to make sure it’s evenly distributed. Let it absorb the seasoning, covered, while you bring it up to room temp. (30 minutes or so straight out of the fridge. You can speed up this process by laying all the chicken out in a single layer on a sheet pan or other large, flat surface. Room temp really is critical to crispy skin and a thorough internal cooking time in line with external browning.)"
- "Combine the jam, brown sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, apple cider vinegar and sriracha in a bowl."
- "In a small saucepan, saute the onions and minced garlic over slightly higher than medium heat in the 3 Tablespoons of oil until the onions turn translucent. Then add the jam mixture, stir to combine ingredients, and turn the heat down to medium low, allowing the glaze to simmer and thicken for about 4 minutes. If it gets hot enough to splatter during the process, turn the heat down a little. If you’d like to add some heat to the glaze, you can add crushed red chili flakes to taste."
- "While the glaze is simmering, preheat your frying oil to somewhere in the 360F to 375F range. I always test the oil by throwing a pinch of flour in to see if it sizzles immediately. While the oil is preheating, toss your chicken in the flour and starch mixture to coat thoroughly."
- "Fry the chicken for 7 to 10 minutes per side, depending on the size of the pieces, and until the chicken skin is a nice, dark, golden brown and set aside on a brown paper bag or paper towel lined dish. If it takes shorter than that, your oil’s probably too hot. Longer than that, not hot enough."
- "When you’re halfway through frying the last batch, quickly re-heat the glaze until it simmers and keep it on low heat while you’re finishing up the frying. You’ll want the glaze nice and hot when you pour it over the chicken."
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine all your fried chicken, and all the glaze (or in two batches - see Step 3, paragraph 3), and toss to coat."
- "Plate and sprinkle with chopped green onions."
- "Enjoy! :)"

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
