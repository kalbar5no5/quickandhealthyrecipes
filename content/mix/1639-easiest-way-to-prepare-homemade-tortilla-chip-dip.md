Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
