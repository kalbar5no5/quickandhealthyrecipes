Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry!
