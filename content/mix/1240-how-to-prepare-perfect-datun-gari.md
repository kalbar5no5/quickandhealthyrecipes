Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
