Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
