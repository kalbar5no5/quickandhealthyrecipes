recipeinstructions:
- "Thoroughly knead the butter, add the sugar, and continue kneading until white and fluffy."

- "Roll the green dough out to about a 3 cm x 12 to 15 cm long rectangle."
- "Roll out 1/5 of the uncolored dough about 1 mm thick and 9 cm by  12-15 cm in size (to match the red dough. Roll out 1/6 of the remaining uncolored dough out to 3 cm x 12 to 15 cm (to match the green dough). Set aside the remaining dough."

- "Press and cut the red dough into 2 1 x 1 cm strips and 2 5 x 2 cm strips, over the plastic wrap, using a ruler."
- "＊Shaping the flower petals＊: Form the strips cut in the previous step so that the red and white (uncolored) dough parts are layered together, as you form the dough into a log while wrapping it in plastic.  (Refer to Step 26 onwards for a more detailed explanation)."
- "Lay down the 2 strips of green (leaf) dough with a 2mm gap in between them. Place the petal dough log on top."
- "Roll out the remaining uncolored dough from step 8 into a 12 cm x 12 to 15 cm rectangle, and place the Step 13 dough assembly in the middle."
- "Wrap tightlly  so that there are no gaps. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze until hard."
- "After the dough is well frozen, slice 7mm thick.  Cut right through the plastic wrap in one go to make the slices nice and neat. Start preheating the oven just before you start slicing the cookie dough."
- "Line the cookies up on a baking sheet carefully, so the dough doesn&#39;t crumble. The cookies will expand, so leave space between them."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
