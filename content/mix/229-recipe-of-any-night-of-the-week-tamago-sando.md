Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
