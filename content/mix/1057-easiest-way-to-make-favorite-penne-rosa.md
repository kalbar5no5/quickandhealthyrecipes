Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
