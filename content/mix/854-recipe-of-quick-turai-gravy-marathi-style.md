Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
