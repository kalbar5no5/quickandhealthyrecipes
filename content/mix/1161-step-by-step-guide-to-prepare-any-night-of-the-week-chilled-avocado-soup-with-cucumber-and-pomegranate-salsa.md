Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
