Soup is my favorite thing to eat this time of year, but it&#39;s not always enough to make a complete meal. Pairing it with a sandwich is a great option, but sometimes I want soup to be the star of the hour.

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
