Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
