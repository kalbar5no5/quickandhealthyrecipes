Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
