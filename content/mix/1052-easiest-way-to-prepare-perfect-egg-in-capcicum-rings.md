These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.
