Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
