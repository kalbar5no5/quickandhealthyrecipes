Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
