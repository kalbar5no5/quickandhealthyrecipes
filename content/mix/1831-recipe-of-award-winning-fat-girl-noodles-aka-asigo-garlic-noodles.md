Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
