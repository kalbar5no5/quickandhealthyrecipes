Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
