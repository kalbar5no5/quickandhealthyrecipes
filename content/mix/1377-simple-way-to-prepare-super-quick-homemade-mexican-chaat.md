Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
