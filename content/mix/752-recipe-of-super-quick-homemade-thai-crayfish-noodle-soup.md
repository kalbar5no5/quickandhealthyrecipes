Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
