Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
