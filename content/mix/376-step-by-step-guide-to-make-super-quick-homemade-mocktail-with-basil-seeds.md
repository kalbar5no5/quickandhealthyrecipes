Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
