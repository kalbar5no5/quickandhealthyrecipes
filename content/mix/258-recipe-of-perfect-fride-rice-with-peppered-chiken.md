How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
