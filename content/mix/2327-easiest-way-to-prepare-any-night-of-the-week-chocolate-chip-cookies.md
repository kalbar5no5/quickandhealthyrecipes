How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
