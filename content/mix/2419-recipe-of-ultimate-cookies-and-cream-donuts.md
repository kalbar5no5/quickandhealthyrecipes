Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
