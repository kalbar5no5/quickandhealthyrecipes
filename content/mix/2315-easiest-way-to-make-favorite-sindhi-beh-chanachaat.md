Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
