Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
