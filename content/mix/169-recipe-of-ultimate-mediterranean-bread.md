Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
