How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
