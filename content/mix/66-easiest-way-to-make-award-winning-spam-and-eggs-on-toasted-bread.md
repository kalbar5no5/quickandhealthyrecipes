Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
