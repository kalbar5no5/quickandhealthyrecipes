Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
