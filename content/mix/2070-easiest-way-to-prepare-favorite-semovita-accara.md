Semovita is made from wheat and d fiber content has been removed. So you are likely to gain more weight from eating semovita than garri. I personally like semovita to garri though am careful about eating starchy foods. Kowor tried but she got some things wrong. The water you will turn the thoroughly mixed dry semo with cold water to, must be at boilling point before you turn the cold semo in, otherwise you will have your semo that taste sugary, that means is &#34;undone&#34; Also note that you must turn simultaneously while adding the dry semo in thin forms, dont add much quantity at a time, turn. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
