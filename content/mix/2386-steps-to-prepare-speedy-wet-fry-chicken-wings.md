Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
