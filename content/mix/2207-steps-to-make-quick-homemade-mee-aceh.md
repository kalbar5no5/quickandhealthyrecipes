Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
