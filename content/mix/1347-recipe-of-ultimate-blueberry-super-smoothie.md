Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
