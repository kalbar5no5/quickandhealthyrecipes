Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
