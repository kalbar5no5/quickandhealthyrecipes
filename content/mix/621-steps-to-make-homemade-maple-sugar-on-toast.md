Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
