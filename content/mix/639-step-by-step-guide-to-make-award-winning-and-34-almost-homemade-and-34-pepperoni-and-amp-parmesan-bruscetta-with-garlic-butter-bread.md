Yet, not a fan of chopping all those tomatoes. Adding a couple ingredients to store bought and serving with homemade garlic bread makes it &#34;semi-homemade&#34; and delicious. One or two pieces of pepperoni per slice is laughable. I want a full layer of pepperoni across the entire surface of the pizza. You can make this happen with a package of pepperoni found in the cold cuts section of your grocery store. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
