Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
