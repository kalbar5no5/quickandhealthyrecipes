If you use sweetened soy milk, I suggest cutting back on the sugar. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
