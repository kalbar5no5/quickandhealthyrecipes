- "You can warm these up in a toaster oven after they&#39;ve turned cold to revive the soft, fluffy texture."
- "I used this instant bechamel sauce mix that you can make by just adding milk."
- "The dough gets flattened when you make the indentations, so I give this a shorter 2nd rising than for usual bread."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
