Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
