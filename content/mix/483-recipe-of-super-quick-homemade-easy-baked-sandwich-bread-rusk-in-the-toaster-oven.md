It is easy to make rusks from regular bread, but because you need to use low oven temperatures, it takes a whileâ€”three to five hours depending on the bread you use. Place a half slice each of ham, Swiss cheese, smoked turkey, and provolone cheese onto each roll bottom. From gooey indoor s&#39;mores to THE BEST baked potatoes, you won&#39;t believe all of the tasty things you can make in your little oven. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
