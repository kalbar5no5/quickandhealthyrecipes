Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
