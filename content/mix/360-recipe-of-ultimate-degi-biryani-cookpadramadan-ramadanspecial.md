Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
