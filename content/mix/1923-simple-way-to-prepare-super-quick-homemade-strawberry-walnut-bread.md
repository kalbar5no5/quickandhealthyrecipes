Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
