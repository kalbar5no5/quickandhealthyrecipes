Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
