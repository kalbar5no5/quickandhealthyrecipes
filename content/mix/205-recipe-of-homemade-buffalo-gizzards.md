Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
