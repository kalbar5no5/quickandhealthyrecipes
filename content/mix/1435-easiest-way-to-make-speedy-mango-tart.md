Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!
