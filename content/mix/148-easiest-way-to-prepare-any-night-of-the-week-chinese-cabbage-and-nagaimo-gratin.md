Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
