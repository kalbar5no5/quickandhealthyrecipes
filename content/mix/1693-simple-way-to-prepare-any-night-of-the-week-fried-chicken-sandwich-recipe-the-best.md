Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
