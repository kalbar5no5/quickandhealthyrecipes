Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
