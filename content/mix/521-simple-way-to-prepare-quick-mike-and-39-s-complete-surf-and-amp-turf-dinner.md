Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
