With TBG&#39;s eighth blogiversary around the corner, I seem to be at the point in my blogging career (and mental state) when I start entirely forgetting about blog posts past. This tart is naturally egg-free, soy-free, and nut-free. If you are dairy-free, you can still make this tart.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook gluten free tomato tarte tartin using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

My mum would often make tarte tatin on a Sunday to have after our Sunday lunch. It was always one of my favourite desserts. However, it has been over two years now since I have had one. Being dairy, soya, egg and gluten free, the idea of caramel and puff pastries become much harder.

##### Steps to make Gluten Free Tomato Tarte Tartin:

1. Preheat the oven to 200 C and cut a circle out of your pasty by cutting it slightly smaller than your oven proof frying pan.
1. Slice the tomatoes in half or into 3 depending on their size and the size of your pan. I test arranged mine in the pan here to make sure I had enough room.
1. Mix the tomatoes with the vinegar, honey, herbs, salt and pepper
1. Arrange your tomatoes, cut side down in your oven proof frying pan.
1. Lightly grease any excess pan around the tomatoes and then lay a circle of pasty over the top.
1. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Use oven gloves taking the pan out and holding the handle as you turn the tart out onto a plate!


However, it has been over two years now since I have had one. Being dairy, soya, egg and gluten free, the idea of caramel and puff pastries become much harder. These tartines are assembled on long slices of crisply toasted baguette topped with a mash of garlic and herb BoursinÂ®, cut with ricotta and goat cheese to make it spreadable. On top, chopped tomatoes, sweet and crunchy, with a drizzle of olive oil, basil, salt and pepper. I love these for lunch or even breakfast. 

Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
