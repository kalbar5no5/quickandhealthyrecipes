Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
