Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
