I&#39;ve also used blade steak and other slow cooking pieces, which worked well also but I found that I had to add extra olive oil to the dish.

Cut steak into thin strips and place in a bowl with the wine, aminos, and cornstarch, set aside. Mix all ingredients for hot garlic sauce together then pour into a skillet and bring to a boil stirring occasionally.

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
