Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
