Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
