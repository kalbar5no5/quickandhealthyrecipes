Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
