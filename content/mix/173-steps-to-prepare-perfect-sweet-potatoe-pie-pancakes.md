Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
