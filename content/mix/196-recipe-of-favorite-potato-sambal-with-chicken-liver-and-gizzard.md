One of my favourite dishes using sambal is chicken liver and potato sambal. Often if I can get it, I would add chicken gizzards too. I know it&#39;s not for everyone, but I happen to I love offals. In Indonesia, potatoes are eaten as a side dish/vegetables rather than a main source of carbohydrates. Now, when the liver and gizzard seem done, stir in potato chunks. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
