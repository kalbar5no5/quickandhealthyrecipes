recipeinstructions:

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
