How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
