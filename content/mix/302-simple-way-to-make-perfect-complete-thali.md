Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
