Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
