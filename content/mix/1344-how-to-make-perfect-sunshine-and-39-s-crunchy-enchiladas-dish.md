Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
