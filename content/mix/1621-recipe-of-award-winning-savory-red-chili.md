Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
