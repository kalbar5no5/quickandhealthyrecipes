Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
