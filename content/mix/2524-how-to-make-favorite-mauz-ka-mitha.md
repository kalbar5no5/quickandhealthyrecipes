Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
