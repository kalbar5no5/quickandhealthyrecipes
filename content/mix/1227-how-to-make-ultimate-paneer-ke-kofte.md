Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
