Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
