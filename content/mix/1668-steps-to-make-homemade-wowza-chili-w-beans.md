Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
