Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
