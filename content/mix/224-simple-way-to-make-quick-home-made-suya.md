Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true.

When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood.

The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body.
