Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
