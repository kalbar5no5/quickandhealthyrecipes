Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
