Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
