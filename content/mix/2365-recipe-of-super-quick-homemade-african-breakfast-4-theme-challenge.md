How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
