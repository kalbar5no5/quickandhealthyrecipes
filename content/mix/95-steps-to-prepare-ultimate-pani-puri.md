Paani poori in Maharashtra, Golgappe in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab while Puchka in West Bengal and Gupchup in parts of Odisha. No points for guessing that Paani Puri is indeed the most loved street. The pani puri water is what binds all the components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani.

The pani puri water is what binds all the components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani. It is all about getting the balance right for a sweet, spicy, tangy, and sour pani. Near the Mumbai region, it is called pani puri. In Kolkata, West Bengal, it is known as puchka or phuchka. 

Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
