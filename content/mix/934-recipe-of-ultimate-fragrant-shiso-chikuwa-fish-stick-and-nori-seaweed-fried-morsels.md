Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
