Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
