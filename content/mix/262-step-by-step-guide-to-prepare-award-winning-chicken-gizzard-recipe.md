How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
