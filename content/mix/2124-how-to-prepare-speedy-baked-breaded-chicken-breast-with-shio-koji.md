Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
