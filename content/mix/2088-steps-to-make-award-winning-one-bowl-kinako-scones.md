How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
