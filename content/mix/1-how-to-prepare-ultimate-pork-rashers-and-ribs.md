Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
