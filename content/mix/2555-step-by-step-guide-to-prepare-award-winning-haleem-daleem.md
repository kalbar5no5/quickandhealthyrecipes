Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
