Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
