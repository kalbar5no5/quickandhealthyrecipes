Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
