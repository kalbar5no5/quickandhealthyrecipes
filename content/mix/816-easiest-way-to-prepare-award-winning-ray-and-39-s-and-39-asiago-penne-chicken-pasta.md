Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
