Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
