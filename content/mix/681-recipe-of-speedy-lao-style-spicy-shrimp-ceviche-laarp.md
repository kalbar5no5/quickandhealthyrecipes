Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
