Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
