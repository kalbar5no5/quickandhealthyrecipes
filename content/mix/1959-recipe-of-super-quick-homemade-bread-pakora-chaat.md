Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
