Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
