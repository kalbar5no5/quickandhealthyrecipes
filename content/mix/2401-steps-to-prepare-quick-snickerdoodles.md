Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, snickerdoodles. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Snickerdoodle cookies are similar to sugar cookies, but technically Since Snickerdoodles are my husband&#39;s most favorite cookie I have made my fair share of them over. A snickerdoodle cookie has to be soft and chewy. These snickerdoodle cookies need to be soft and chewy so watch carefully. If you want them to be flat, press the balls down in the center before.

Snickerdoodles is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. Snickerdoodles is something which I've loved my whole life. They're nice and they look fantastic.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have snickerdoodles using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Snickerdoodles:

1. Take 1 1/2 cup sugar
1. Get 1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1. Take 1/2 cup shortening
1. Take 2 eggs
1. Get 2 3/4 cup all purpose or unbleached flour
1. Prepare 2 tsp cream of tartar
1. Get 1 tsp baking soda
1. Make ready 1/4 tsp salt
1. Make ready 1/4 cup sugar
1. Make ready 2 tsp cinnamon


These Snickerdoodles are leavened using a combination of cream of tartar and baking soda. Try chai spiced and pumpkin spice versions, too! A plain snickerdoodle is good, but wouldn&#39;t you rather have it stuffed with cheesecake, blended into a milkshake, or crumbled on top of a summer fruit crisp? Now may not be the best time to admit this, but I don&#39;t like snickerdoodles.

A plain snickerdoodle is good, but wouldn&#39;t you rather have it stuffed with cheesecake, blended into a milkshake, or crumbled on top of a summer fruit crisp? Now may not be the best time to admit this, but I don&#39;t like snickerdoodles. I never have and sadly, I don&#39;t think I ever will. To me, Snickerdoodles are the quintessential Christmas cookie. Most of all, snickerdoodles remind me of baking with my mom around the holidays, and therefore will always be the top cookie in my book. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
