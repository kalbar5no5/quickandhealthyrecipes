Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
