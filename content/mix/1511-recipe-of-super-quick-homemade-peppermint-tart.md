Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
