Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
