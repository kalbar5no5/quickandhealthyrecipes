Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
