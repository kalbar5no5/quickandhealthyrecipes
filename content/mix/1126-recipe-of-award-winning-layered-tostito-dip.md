Make the best Layered Greek Dip for any occasion. Place a layer of tomato, green bell pepper, green onions and lettuce over the salsa, and top with Cheddar cheese. Classic seven layer dip consists of refried beans, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, cheese, olives and tomatoes, although there are a ton of other versions out there. I&#39;m not a huge fan of refried beans, so I make mine with black beans, instead.

Layered Tostito Dip is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions every day. Layered Tostito Dip is something that I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

And many recipes add additional flavors as toppings. Seven layer bean dip begins with refried beans mixed with milk. Using a hand mixer not only makes the mixing easy, it helps with a creamy consistency so your chips don&#39;t break as you scoop it! Just like in Jalapeno Popper Dip, mix the cream cheese with a hand mixer too so it&#39;s easy to scoop. Seven layer dip is one of my favorites. 

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
