Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
