Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
