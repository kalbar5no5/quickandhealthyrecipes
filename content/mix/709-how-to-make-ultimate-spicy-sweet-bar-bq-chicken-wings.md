Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
