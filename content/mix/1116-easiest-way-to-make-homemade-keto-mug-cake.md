Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
