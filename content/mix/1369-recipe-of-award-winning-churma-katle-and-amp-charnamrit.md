Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
