Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
