Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
