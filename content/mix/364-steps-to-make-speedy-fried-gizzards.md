Snap the lid on and shake until combined. In the first camp, there are the succulent-loving folk, and these eaters enjoy the fork-tender quality of gizzards that have been stewed for a long time before being deep-fried. The second camp comprises the masticators, who like a bit more bite to their morsels. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
