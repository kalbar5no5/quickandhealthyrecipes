- "200-250 g spaghetti"
- " Salt"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "2 onions chopped"
- "180 g bacon medallionsrashers chopped I prefer unsmoked but smoked is fine if preferred"
- "2 eggs"
- "5 tbsp halffat crme frache"
- "20 g Parmesan cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring salted water to boil ready for the spaghetti. Time cooking to reach al dente and be drained ready for Step 5. Fresh spaghetti will take 3 minutes, dried spaghetti about 8-10 minutes but follow the packet’s instructions. Please note that the pasta must be immediately added to the onions and bacon and not allowed to cool. This is to ensure that the eggs, which are added immediately after the spaghetti, are cooked properly."
- "Beat the eggs, add the Parmesan cheese and crème fraîche and beat with a fork until well-mixed and forming a creamy sauce. Do this before starting the pasta if using fresh spaghetti."
- "Gently fry the onions and bacon in the oil until soft (about 6 or 7 minutes). Stir gently if needed to avoid sticking."
- "Take out and reserve a cup of the pasta water, then drain the spaghetti in a colander."
- "Add the spaghetti to the onions and bacon, then immediately add the egg sauce. Stir thoroughly to ensure that the egg mixture gets cooked along with the rest. If the sauce is quite dry and needs loosening, stir in a small amount of the pasta water. Once the egg is cooked, serve immediately. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese on top of the served portions if wished."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
