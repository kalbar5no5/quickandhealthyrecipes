Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
