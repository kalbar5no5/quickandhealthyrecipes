Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
