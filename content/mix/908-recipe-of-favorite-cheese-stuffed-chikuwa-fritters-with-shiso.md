Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
