Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
