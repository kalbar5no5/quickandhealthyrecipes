Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
