Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
