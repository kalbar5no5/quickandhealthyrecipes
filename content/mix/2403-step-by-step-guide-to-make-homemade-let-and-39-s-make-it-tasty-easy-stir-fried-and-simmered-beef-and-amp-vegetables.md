recipeingredient:
- "200 to 300 grams  Thinly sliced beef offcuts"
- "1 large Burdock root"
- "1 large Lotus root"
- "1 regular Carrot"
- "1 heaping tablespoon Grated ginger"
- "1/8 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 to finish Green onion optional"
- " The flavoring ingredients"
- "3 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "3 tbsp  2 tablespoons Mirin"
- "2 heaping teaspoons Sugar light brown sugar preferred"
- "2 tbsp Sake"
- "1 dash Red chili pepper"
- "1 handful Toasted sesame seeds"
- " Oil for frying"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil or vegetable oil"
- "1 small cube Beef fat"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the burdock root, lotus root and carrot into large slivers. Don&#39;t cut them up too small, since you want to enjoy their texture. Not too big, either, though!"
- "Cut the veggies in the direction of the grain (or fiber). This way they&#39;ll retain their texture when cooked."
- "Soak the cut up vegetables in water, changing it several times, to get rid of bitterness. Put a little vinegar in the soaking water. Parboil the cut-up veggies briefly."
- "Boil the burdock root for 30 seconds, then add the lotus root and cook for another 30 seconds (1 minute total for the burdock root, 30 seconds for the lotus root.) If you cook it for too long, you&#39;ll lose that crunchy texture."
- "You don&#39;t need to parboil the carrot, since it cooks quickly. Drain everything well. No need to soak in cold water again."
- "Pre-flavor the beef with 2 tablespoons of sake, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of mirin. Sake will make it tender, and pre-flavoring it makes the taste distinctive. Work the pre-flavoring ingredients in well with your hands."
- "Let&#39;s start stir-frying! Put a little oil in a pan with a small piece of beef fat. This makes cheap and lean beef tasty. If you&#39;re using a fatty part of beef, you don&#39;t need it."
- "If you put the meat in the pan before it&#39;s heated, you can separate the slices easily."
- "Let&#39;s cook over high heat now. Stir fry the beef properly, then add the rest of the ingredients. Stir it up well with a spatula."
- "Now we&#39;ll work fast! Stir fry for 2 minutes, add the sugar → sake → mirin. The sugar goes first."
- "When the moisture has evaporated and the sugar is kind of sticky, stir fry for another minute over high heat. When everything is shiny, add the soy sauce."
- "When everything is coated well with soy sauce, pour in the mirin and stir everything up from the bottom. Stir fry to evaporate the mirin. When everything&#39;s shiny, add sesame seeds and chili pepper."
- "Mix it all up and it&#39;s done. It goes well with rice. Great when cooled, too. You can use it for bentos, right?"
- "I made double the amount and turned half of it into &#34;Beef and burdock root rice.&#34; See."

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
