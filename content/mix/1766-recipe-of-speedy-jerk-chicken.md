Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
