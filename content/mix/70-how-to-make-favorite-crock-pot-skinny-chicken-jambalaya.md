Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
