recipeingredient:
- "250 g sushi rice "
- "120 ml Saitaku rice vinegar"
- "300 g tofu"
- "2 tbsp Kikkoman Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- " Lime juice"
- "1 Carrot "

- " Lettuce "
- "100 g Corns"
- "2 tsp Black Sesame Seeds"
- " Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice thoroughly in a strainer or colander under the tap. Once the water that comes out of the rice is completely transparent and therefore clean, you can start boiling the rice. Put in a pan with the 400 milliliters of water and bring to the boil. Then lower the heat and cook the rice for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes with the lid on the pan.  (Chef‚Äôs Note: Keep in mind that the rice still needs to cool down after cooking. This can easily take an hour.)"
- "Meanwhile, heat the rice vinegar with the salt and pepper in another pan. This is the dressing for the rice."
- "Pour the dressing over the rice and stir a few times. Allow cooling (if necessary in a large bowl, that goes a little faster) to room temperature."
- "Meanwhile, mix the soy sauce with Sriracha, sesame oil and lime juice. Cut the tofu into small cubes of 1 x 1 centimeter and marinate in the soy sauce mixture."
- "Heat the rice vinegar in a small pan and cut the radishes into thin slices. Marinate for five to ten minutes in the vinegar."
- "Slice the avocado, mango, carrot, cucumber, lettuce and the onions. Spoon the slightly cooled rice (rather a little warm, then cold) into bowls. Divide the tofu, avocado, corns, mango slices, carrot and cucumber slices with the lettuce on this. Top the poke bowl with sesame seeds and possibly chili flakes and serve immediately."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
