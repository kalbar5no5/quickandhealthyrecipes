Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
