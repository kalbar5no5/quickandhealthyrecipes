Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
