Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels.

Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
