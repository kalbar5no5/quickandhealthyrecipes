Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
