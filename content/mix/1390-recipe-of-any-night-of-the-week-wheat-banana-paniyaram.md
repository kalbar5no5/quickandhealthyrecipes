Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
