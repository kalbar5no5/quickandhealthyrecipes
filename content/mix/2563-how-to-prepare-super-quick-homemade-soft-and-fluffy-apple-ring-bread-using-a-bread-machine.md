Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
