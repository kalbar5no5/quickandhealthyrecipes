Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
