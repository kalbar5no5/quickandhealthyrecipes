It&#39;s an Indian style sauce - outrageously addictive, and pairs beautifully with chicken, vegetables and legumes. Low-cal, low-carb, and HEALTHY but tastes like comfort food!!

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
