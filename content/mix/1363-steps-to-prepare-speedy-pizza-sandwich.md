Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
