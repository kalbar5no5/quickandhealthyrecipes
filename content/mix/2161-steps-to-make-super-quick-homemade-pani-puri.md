Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
