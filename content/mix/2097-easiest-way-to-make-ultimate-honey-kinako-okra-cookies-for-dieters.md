Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
