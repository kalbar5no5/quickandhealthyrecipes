Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!
