Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
