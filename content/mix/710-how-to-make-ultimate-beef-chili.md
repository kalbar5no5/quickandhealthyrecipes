Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
