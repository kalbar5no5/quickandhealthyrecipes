Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
