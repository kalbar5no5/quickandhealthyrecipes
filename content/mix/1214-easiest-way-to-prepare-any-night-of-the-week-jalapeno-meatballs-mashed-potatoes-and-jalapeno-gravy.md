Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
