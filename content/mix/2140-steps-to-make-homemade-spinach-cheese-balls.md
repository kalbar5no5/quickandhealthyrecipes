Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
