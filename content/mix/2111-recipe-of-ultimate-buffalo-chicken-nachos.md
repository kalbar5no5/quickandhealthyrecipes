Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
