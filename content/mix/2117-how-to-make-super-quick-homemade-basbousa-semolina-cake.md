Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
