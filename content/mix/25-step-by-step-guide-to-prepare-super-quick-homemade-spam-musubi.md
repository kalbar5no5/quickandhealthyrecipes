Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
