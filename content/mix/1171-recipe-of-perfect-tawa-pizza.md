Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
