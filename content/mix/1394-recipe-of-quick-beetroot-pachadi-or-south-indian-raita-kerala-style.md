Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
