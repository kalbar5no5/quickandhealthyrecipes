Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
