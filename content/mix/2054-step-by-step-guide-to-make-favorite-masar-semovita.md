Semolina, Fufu, Amala, Tuwo Masar a and Tuwo Shinkafa are popular bolus meals eaten with Nigerian soups. These bolus meals are available in form of powder/flour and quite easy to prepare once you have the flour ready. From time to time, I substitute any of them with wheat flour or wheat meal whenever possible. 

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
