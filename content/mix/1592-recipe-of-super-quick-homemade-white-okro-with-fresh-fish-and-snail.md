Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
