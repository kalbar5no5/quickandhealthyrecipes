Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
