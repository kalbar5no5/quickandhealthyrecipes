Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
