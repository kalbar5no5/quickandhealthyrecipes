Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them.
