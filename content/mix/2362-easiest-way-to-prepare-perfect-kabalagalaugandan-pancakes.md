Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
