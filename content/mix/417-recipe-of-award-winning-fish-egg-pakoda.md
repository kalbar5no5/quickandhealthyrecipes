Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
