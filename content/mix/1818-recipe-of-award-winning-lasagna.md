Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
