Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
