Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
