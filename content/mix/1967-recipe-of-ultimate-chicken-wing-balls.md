Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
