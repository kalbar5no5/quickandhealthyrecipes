Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
