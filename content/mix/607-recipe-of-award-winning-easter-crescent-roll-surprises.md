Place onto cookie sheet, and gently press dough almost together in center, leaving a small well in center. Brush tops of dough rolls with melted butter, and sprinkle with nonpareils and granulated. Crescent dough wraps around butter- and sugar-dipped marshmallows. They become hollow as they bake, representing Jesus&#39; tomb on Easter morning -- when you break them open they are empty inside! A great Easter recipe to share with the kids! 

Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
