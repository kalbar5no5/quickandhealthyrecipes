Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
