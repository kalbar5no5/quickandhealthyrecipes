Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
