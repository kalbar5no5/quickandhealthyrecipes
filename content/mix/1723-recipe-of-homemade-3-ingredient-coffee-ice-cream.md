Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
