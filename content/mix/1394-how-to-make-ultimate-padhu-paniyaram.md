Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
