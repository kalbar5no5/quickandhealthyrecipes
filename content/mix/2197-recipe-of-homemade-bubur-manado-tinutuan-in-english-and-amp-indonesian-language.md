Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
