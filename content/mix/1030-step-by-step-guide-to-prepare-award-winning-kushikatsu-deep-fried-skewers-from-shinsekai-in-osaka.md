Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
