Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
