Kefta (or kofta) is a deliciously spiced and tender type of Moroccan kebab made using ground beef or lamb. The mixture is flavored with cumin, paprika, minced onion, coriander, and parsley and formed into skewers. The cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and mint leaves are optional but highly recommended. Mash the garlic into a paste with the salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef&#39;s knife on your cutting board.

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
