Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
