Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
