Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
