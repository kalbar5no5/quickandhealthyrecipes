Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
