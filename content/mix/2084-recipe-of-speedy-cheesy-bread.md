Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
