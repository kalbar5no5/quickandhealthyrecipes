Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
