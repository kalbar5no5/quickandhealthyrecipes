How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
