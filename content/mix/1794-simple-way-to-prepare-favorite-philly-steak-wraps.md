Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
