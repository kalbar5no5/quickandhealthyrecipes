Most commonly &#39;Aonori&#39; (Dried Green Laver Flakes) is added to the batter. Finely crumbled Nori, Hijiki, Wakame, or other Seaweed can be used.

The noodles are cooked with sliced pork and plenty of vegetables, then coated with a special sauce. What distinguishes Yakisoba from other Asian stir-fried noodles is this special sauce, which is sweet and a little bit spicy. Yakisoba is known as one of the popular street foods in Japan. Karaage (唐揚げ 空揚げ or から揚げ, ) is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods—most often chicken, but also other meat and fish—are deep fried in oil. The process involves lightly coating small pieces of the meat or fish with flour, or potato or corn starch, and frying in a light oil. 

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
