Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
