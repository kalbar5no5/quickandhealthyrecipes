Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
