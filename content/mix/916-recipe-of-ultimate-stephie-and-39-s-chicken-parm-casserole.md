Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
