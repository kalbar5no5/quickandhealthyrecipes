Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
