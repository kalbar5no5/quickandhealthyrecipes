Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
