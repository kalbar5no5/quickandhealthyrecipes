Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
