Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
