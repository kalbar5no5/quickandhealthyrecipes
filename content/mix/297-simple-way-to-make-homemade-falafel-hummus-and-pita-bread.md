How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
