Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
