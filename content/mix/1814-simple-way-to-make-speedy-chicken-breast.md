Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
