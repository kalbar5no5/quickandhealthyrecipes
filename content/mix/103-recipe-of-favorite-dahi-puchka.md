Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
