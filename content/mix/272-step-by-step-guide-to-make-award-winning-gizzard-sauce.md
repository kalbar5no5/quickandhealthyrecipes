Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
