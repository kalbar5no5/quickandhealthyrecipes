Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
