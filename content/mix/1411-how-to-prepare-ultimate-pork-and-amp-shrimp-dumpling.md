Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
