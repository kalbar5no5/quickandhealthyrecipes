Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
