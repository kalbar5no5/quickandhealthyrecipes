Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
