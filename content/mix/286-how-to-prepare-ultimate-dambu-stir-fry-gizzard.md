Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
