Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
