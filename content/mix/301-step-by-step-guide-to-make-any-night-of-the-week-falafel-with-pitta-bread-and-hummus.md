Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
