Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
