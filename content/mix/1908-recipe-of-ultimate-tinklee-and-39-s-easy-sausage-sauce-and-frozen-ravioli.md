Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
