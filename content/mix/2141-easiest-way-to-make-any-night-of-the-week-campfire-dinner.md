Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
