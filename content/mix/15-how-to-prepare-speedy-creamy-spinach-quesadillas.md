Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
