Apple cider vinegar- this helps add tangy flavor to the dressing and thin it out a bit. You can use another acid, like another vinegar or lemon or lime juice, if you want. Parsley, green onions, and garlic powder - for the dressing. You can use other herbs, like dill and/or cilantro, in addition to or as a substitute for the parsley.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
