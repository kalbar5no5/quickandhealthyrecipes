Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
