Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
