Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
