Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production.

Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
