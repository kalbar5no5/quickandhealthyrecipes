Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
