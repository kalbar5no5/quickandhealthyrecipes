Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
