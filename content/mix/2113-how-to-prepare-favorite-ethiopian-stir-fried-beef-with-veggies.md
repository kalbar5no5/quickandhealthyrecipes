Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
