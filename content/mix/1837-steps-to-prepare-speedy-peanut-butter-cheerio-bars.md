Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
