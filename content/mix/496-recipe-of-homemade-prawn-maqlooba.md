Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
