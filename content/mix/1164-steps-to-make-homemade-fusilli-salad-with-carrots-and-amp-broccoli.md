How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
