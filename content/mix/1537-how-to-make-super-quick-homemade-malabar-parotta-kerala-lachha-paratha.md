How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
