Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
