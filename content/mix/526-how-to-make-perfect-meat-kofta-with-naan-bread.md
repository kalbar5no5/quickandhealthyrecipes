You&#39;ve likely eaten naan at your favorite restaurant, picked up a fresh or frozen package of it at the grocery store, or made it at home. The tasty Indian flatbread is yeast-leavened and traditionally baked in a clay oven called a tandoor. The fluffy bread holds infinite potential in your kitchen — especially when it comes to changing up your lunch routine. Typically, these kofta balls are then tossed in a cream based curry and enjoyed with a bread (like naan) or rice. In India, you will typically find kofta in a spiced curry or gravy while in Iran and Iraq it can be cooked in a spiced gravy or as a kebab. 

Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
