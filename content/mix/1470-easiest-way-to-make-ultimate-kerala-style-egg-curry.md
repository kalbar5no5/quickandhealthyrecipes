Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
