Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
