Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
