Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
