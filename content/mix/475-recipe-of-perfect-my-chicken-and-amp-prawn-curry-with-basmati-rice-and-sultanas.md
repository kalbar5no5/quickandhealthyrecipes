Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
