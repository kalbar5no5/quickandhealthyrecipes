Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
