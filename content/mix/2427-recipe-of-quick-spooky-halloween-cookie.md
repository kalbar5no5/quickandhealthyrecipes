Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
