Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
