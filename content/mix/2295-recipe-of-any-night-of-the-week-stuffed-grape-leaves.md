Stuffed Grape Leaves (Greek Dolmades) are often served as part of a meze (appetizer) plate. Too often they come from a can and are not fresh. These Vegetarian Stuffed Grape Leaves are a Mediterranean classic recipe made with short grain rice, parsley, tomatoes and onions - my favorite appetizer! The use of grape leaves to wrap food dates back to the days of Alexander the Great. While Americans tend to think of stuffed grape leaves as a Greek delicacy, dolmadaki may have originated. 

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
