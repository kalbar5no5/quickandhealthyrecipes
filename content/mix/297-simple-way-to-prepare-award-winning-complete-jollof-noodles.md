Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
