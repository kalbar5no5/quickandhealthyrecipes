Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!
