On a winter day, when one wants a bowl of warm comfort food, dal dhokli is the answer. I enjoyed it so much that I had to share the legacy of the dish with you all. Dal Dhokli is a one-pot meal made by boiling wheat flour noodles in sweet- savory-tangy pigeon pea lentil (Tur Dal). It is a very famous Gujrati dish and is considered as comfort food. Since the base of the dish is Tur dal, it is loaded with protein. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
