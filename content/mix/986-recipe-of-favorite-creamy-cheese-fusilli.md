Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
