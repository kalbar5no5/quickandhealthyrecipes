Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
