Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
