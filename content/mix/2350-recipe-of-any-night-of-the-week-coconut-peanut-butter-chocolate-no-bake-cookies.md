Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
