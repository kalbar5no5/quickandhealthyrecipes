Many dishes in Japanese cuisine can easily be made vegan, as is the case for this traditional Japanese New Year&#39;s soup, known as zoni, also called ozoni (honorific term). Ozoni is a soup consisting of vegetables and mochi (rice cake) and may include chicken, fish, seafood, or kamaboko (fish cake) in non-vegan versions. Tradition runs in my family in Japan. In my family, we eat mochi miso soup in the morning for breakfast on New Year&#39;s Day.

Tradition runs in my family in Japan. In my family, we eat mochi miso soup in the morning for breakfast on New Year&#39;s Day. My mom says that it is a New Year&#39;s breakfast food, thanking God for good harvesting, that our family lived safely in the previous year, and to receive the grace of God. Unlike white miso-based Ozoni enjoyed in western Japan (Kansai, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions), clear dashi-based soup is the mainstream in Tokyo and eastern Japan (Read this post to learn some of the differences between eastern and western Japan.). The soup includes toasted mochi, chicken, and komatsuna (小松菜) - Japanese mustard spinach, usually harvested in. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
