Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
