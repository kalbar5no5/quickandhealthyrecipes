Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
