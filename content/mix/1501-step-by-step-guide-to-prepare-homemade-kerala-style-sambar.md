Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
