Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
