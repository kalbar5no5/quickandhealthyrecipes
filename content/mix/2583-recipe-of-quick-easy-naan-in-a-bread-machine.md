Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
