Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
