Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
