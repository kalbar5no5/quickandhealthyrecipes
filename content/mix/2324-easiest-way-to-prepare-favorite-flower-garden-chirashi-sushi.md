Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
