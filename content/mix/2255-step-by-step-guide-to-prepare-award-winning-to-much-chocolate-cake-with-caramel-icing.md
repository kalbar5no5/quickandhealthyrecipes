Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
