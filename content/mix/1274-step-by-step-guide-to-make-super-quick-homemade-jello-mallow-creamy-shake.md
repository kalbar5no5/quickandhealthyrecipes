Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts.

The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest.
