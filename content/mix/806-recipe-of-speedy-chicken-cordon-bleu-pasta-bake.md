Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
