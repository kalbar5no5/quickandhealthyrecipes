Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
