Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
