Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
