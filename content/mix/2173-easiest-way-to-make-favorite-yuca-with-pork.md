Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
