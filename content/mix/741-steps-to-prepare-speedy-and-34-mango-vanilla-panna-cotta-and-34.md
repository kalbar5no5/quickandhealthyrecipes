Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
