Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
