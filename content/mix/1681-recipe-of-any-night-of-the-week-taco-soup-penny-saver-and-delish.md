Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
