Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
