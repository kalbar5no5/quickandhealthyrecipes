Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
