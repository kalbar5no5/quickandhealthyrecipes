Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
