Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
