Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
