Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
