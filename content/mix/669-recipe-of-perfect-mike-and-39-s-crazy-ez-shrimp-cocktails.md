Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
