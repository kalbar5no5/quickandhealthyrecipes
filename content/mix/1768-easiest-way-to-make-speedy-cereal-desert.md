How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
