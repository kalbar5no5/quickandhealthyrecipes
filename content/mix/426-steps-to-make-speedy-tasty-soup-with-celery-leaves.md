Tips from the cook--By most definitions, a whole head of celery is a stalk and a single &#34;stick&#34; from the stalk is a rib. Using large quantities of celery that cooks it in stock with a touch of garlic, makes a soup that is full of flavor without the need of complicated ingredients.

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
