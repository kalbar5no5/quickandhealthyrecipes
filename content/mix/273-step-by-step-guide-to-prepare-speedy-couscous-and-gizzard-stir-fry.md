How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
