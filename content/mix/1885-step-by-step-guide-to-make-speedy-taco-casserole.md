Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
