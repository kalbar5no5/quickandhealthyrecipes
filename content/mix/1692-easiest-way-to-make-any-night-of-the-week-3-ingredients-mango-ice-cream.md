Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
