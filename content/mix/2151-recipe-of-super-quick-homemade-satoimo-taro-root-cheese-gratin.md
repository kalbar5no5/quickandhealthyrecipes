Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
