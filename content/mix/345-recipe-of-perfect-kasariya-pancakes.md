In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. Melt the butter in a large cast iron. The pancakes are traditionally topped with okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker), mayonnaise, beni shoga (red pickled ginger), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), and aonori (seaweed flakes). The items are popular because Kasia&#39;s Pierogi, Blintzes and Potato Pancakes are made using family traditions that result in a taste that is truly timeless. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
