Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
