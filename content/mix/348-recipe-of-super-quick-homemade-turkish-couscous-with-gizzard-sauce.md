Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
