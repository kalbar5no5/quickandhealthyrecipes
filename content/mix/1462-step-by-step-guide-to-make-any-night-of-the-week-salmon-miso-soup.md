Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
