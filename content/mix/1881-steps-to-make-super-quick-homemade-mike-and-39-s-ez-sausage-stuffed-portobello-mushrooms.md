Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
