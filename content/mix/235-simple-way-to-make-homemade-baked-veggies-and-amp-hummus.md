Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
