recipeinstructions:
- "I used my griddle iron with this recipe, you don&#39;t want it to be too hot or your pancake will brown slightly. I recommend seeing it a little under 350 not over 360."
- "Grease your griddle or pan lightly with cooking oil, olive oil, or if you have some spray on like PAM."
- "In a medium or large bowl pour in your measured amounts of complete pancake mix and your red velvet mix."
- "Add your water and mix. The mix well be pasty from the red velvet mix. that is ok, that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be."
- "Take your butter and I&#39;m small pieces drop it into the mix."
- "Add one or two splashes of milk. I used 2% milk (personally), mix by hand. I mixed with a simple spoon. there will be small lumps of butter and that is fine. mix until there isn&#39;t many but they will not be of any harm. you can probably mix with your mixer to make your mixture smoother, if not you&#39;ll be fine."
- "Once griddle is hot, pour on your mixture until you&#39;ve reached your desired size."
- "Allow them to cook just as you would any pancakes. Until it bubbles on the top and flip. I recommend 2-3 minutes each side but keep an eye on them as it may not take as long. you don&#39;t want them to cook too long."
- "Once they are done I like to drizzle then with an homemade icing made from cream cheese."
- "I&#39;m not sure if this recipe works with any other pancake and red velvet mixes. I wanted red velvet pancakes and gave this a try and they came out PERFECT for me and my boys. A great alternative to making them completely from scratch. I truly hope you guys enjoy."

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
