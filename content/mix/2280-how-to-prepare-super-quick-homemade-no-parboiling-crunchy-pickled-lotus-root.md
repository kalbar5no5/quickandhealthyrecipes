Lotus roots — especially the younger and more tender ones — are sometimes served pickled in salads. When cooking lotus root, it is helpful to have some water on hand to which a little lemon juice or vinegar has been added. Submerging the peeled and sliced lotus root in water containing acid will prevent discoloration. Bring water to boil in a sauce pan and add lotus root. Return to boil and let it cook for three to four minutes, until cooked through but still slightly crunchy. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
