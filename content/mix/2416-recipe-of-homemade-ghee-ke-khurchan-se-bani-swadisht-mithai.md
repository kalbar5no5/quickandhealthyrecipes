Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
