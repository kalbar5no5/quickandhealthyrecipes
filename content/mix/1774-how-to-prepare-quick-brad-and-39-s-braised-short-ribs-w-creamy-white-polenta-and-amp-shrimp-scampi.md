Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
