Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
