Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
