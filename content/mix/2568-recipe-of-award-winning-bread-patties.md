Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
