Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
