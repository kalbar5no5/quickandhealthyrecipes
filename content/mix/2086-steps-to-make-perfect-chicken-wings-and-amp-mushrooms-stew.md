Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
