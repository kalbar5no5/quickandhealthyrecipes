Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
