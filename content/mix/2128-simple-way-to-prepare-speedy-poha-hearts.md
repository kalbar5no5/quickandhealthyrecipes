Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
