Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
