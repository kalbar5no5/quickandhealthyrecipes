Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
