Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
