Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
