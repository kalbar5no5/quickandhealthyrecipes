Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
