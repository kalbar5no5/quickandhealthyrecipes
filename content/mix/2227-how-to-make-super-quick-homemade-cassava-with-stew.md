How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
