Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
