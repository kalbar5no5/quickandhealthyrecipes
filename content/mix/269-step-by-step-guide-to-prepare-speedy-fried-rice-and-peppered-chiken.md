Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
