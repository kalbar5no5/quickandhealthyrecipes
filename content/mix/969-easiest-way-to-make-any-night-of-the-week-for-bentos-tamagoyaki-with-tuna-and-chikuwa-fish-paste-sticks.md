Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
