Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
