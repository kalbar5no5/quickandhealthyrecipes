recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Lys dOr semistrong bread flour"
- "195 grams plus Water"
- "5 grams plus Sugar"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "4 grams Dried yeast"
- "1 grams Malt powder optional"
- "1 Rice flour or bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients in a bread machine and use the &#39;dough-only&#39; program. When the 1st rising is done, take the dough out, deflate it and round it off. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and rest the dough for 15 to 20 minutes."
- "The dough is very soft, so deflate it gently and round it off again."
- "Dust the banneton (bread-rising mold) evenly with flour (rice flour or bread flour) using a tea strainer. I used rice flour this time."
- "Put the dough with the smooth side down and the seam side up in the banneton."
- "Let the dough rise to about 1.5 to a bit less than 2 times its original volume at around 35°C. Start preheating the oven to 250°C so that it&#39;s ready when the dough has finished rising. Heat up the oven tray if there is one at the same time."
- "If your oven has a steam function, use that. If it doesn&#39;t, mist the surface of the dough from a little distance in Step 7."
- "Invert a sheet of kitchen parchment paper over the mold, hold both with your hands and invert carefully to transfer the dough to the paper. Slash the top of the dough, and transfer the dough, paper and all, to the oven tray to bake. (Be careful not to burn yourself.)"
- "Turn the oven temperature down from 250°C to 230°C, and start baking the bread for 10 minutes. Turn the temperature down again to 200 to 220°C and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. This is just a guideline, so please adjust the temperatures depending on how brown you want the crust to be and so on."
- "Let the bread cool down after it&#39;s baked. You can hand-knead the dough too. Seehard-crust rolls for hand kneading instructions."
- "When I hand-knead the dough, I knead it for a short time and let it rise (1st rising) for a longer time. This results in nice air pockets in the crumb, and a great fragrance."
- "I tried making little rolls with the same dough. They&#39;re round and cute. I drizzled a little olive oil into the slashes on top. See."
- "I tried baking the dough as a rounded-top square loaf. It&#39;s so crispy when it&#39;s toasted. Seefor forming instructions."
- "Since it&#39;s kneaded well in a bread machine, I called it a &#34;Soft French bread&#34;. If you knead it for a shorter time, it will be a harder pain de campagne-type bread (see next step)."
- "If kneaded for a shorter time, the bread will have a harder texture. For that type of bread, knead the dough in the bread machine for 5 to 6 minutes, take it out and start the 1st rising. (In the wintertime use lukewarm water in the dough.)"
- "Here&#39;s a pain de campagne using natural leaven. You can also try making it with a tiny amount of yeast. See."
- "This is an oven pain de campagne using natural leaven, whole wheat flour and rye flour. See. You can use a tiny bit if yeast instead, and/or use a round banneton."

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
