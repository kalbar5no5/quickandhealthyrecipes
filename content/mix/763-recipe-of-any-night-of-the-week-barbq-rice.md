Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
