Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body.
