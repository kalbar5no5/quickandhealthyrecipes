Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food

Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels.

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest.
