Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
