Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, vegetable paniyaram. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Vegetable paniyaram is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look fantastic. Vegetable paniyaram is something that I have loved my whole life.

Vegetable Paniyaram is a South Indian breakfast recipe made from idli/dosa batter and known as kuzhi Paniyaram in Tamil,Paddu in Kannada and Gunta Ponugulu in Telugu. Drop the batter to fill the mold. Then turn and cook on the other side. Turn again if necessary to make sure the paniyaram is evenly cooked on both sides and its nicely golden in colour.


To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook vegetable paniyaram using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.

Paniyaram is a popular south Indian breakfast dish usually made with leftover idli or dosa batter. Here I have made it with a blend of rice with chana dal (Bengal gram) and urad dal (skinned and split black gram). Kuzhi Paniyaram is basically a popular South Indian breakfast dish. It is generally made using the left over Idly Dosa batter in a cast iron paniyaram pan.

Kuzhi Paniyaram is basically a popular South Indian breakfast dish. It is generally made using the left over Idly Dosa batter in a cast iron paniyaram pan. But my mom never made them using left over idly batter , she always made the batter for Paniyaram from scratch and it had chana dal along with rice. Take paniyaram batter in a bowl, all the ingredients &amp; mix well. Heat paniyaram tawa (Iron casting tastes better than other material) &amp; grease with oil then pour batter. 

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
