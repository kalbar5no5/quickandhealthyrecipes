Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
