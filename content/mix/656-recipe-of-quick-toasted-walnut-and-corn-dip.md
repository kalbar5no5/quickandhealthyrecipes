Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
