How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
