Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
