Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
