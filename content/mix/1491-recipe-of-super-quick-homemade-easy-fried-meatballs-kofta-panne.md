Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
