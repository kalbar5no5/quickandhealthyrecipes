Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
