How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
