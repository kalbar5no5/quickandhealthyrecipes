Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
