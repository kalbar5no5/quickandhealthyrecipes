Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
