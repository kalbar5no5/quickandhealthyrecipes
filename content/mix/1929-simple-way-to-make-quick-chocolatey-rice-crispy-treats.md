Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
