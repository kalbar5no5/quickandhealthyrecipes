Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
