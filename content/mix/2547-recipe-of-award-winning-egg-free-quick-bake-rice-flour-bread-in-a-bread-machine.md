How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
