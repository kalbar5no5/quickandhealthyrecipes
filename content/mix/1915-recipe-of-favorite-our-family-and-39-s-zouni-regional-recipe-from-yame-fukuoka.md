Many dishes in Japanese cuisine can easily be made vegan, as is the case for this traditional Japanese New Year&#39;s soup, known as zoni, also called ozoni (honorific term). Ozoni is a soup consisting of vegetables and mochi (rice cake) and may include chicken, fish, seafood, or kamaboko (fish cake) in non-vegan versions. Tradition runs in my family in Japan. In my family, we eat mochi miso soup in the morning for breakfast on New Year&#39;s Day.

Tradition runs in my family in Japan. In my family, we eat mochi miso soup in the morning for breakfast on New Year&#39;s Day. My mom says that it is a New Year&#39;s breakfast food, thanking God for good harvesting, that our family lived safely in the previous year, and to receive the grace of God. Unlike white miso-based Ozoni enjoyed in western Japan (Kansai, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions), clear dashi-based soup is the mainstream in Tokyo and eastern Japan (Read this post to learn some of the differences between eastern and western Japan.). The soup includes toasted mochi, chicken, and komatsuna (小松菜) - Japanese mustard spinach, usually harvested in. 

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
