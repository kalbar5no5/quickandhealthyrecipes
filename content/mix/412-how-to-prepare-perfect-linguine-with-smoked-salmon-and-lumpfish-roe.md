Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!
