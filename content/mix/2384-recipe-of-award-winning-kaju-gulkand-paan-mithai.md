Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
