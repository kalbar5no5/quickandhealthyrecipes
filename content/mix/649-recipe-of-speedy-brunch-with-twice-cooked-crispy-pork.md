Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
