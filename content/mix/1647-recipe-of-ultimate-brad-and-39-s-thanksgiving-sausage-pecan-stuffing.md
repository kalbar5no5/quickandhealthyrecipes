Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
