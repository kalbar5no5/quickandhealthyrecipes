Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
