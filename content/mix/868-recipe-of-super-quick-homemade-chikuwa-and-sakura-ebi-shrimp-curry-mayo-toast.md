Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
