Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
