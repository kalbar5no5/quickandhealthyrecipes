Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
