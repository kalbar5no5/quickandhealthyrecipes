Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
