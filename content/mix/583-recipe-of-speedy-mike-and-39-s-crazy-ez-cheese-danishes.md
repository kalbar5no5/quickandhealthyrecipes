Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
