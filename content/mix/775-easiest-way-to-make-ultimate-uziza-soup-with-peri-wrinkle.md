Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
