Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
