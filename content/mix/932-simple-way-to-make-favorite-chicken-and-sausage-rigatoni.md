Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
