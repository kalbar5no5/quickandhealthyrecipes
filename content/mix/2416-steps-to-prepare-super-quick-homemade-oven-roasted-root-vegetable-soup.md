Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
