Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
