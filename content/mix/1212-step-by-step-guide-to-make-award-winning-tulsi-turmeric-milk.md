Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
