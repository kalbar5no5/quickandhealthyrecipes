Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
