Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
