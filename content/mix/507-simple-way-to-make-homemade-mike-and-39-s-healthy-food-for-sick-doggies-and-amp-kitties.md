Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
