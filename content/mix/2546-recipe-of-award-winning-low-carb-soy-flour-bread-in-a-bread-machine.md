Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
