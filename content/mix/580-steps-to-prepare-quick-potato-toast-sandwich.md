Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
