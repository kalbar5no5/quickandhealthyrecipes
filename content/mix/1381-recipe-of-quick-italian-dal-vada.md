Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
