Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
