Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
