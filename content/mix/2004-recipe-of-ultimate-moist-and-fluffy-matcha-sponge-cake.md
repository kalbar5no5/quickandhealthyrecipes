recipeingredient:
- "3 Eggs large"
- "80 grams Flour"
- "10 grams Matcha"
- "90 grams Sugar"
- "40 grams Butter"
- "30 ml Milk"
- "1 tbsp Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the eggs to room temperature. Combine the flour with matcha, and sift 2 to 3 times. Line the cake pan with parchment paper. If you grease the pan slightly, the lining will stick."
- "Microwave the milk and butter in the same container. Make sure the butter is completely melted. Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "Crack the eggs into a bowl, and add the sugar. Warm the bowl over warm water at about 60℃, and whisk with a hand-held mixer in high speed."
- "When the eggs are about 36℃ (slightly warm when tested with your fingers), remove from the warm water and continue to whisk at high speed. Use the same warm water to keep the temperature of the milk and butter."
- "When it gets thick and creamy. This usually takes 5 minutes after placing the bowl over warm water. Continue to whisk at low speed for about 3 minutes."
- "It gets glossier than when whisked at high speed."
- "Change the whisk. Add 1 tablespoon water and whip lightly. By adding water, it makes the powdered ingredients blend easier."
- "Add all powdered ingredients in one go. Whip about 30 to 35 times."
- "Remove the milk and butter from the warm water. Mix in a small portion of the mixture from step 8. This makes it easier than adding the milk and butter directly into the mixture."
- "Add the mixture from step 9 into the bowl from step 8. Use a rubber spatula to cut in and blend. Make sure it gets creamy and glossy."
- "Pour the mixture into the cake pan."
- "Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the 170℃ preheated oven."
- "Test with a skewer. If it doesn&#39;t come out clean, bake for another 5 minutes. Watch the cake as you bake."
- "When it&#39;s done, drop from about 20 cm above your workplace. This prevents any shrinking."
- "Turn it upside down and remove from the pan onto a rack. Peel any parchment paper. Cover with a damp cloth and let it cool."
- "When it&#39;s completely cooled down, put it in a plastic bag and chill in the fridge for about half to one whole day."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
