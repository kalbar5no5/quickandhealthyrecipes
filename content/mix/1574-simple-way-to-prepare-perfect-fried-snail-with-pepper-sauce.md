Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body.
