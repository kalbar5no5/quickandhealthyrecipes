Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
