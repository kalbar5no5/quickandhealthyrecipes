Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
