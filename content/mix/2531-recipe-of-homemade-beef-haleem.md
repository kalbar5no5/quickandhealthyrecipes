Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
