Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
