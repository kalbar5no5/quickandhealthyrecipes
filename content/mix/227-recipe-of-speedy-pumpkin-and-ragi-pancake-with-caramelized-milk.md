Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
