Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
