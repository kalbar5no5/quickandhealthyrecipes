Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
