Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
