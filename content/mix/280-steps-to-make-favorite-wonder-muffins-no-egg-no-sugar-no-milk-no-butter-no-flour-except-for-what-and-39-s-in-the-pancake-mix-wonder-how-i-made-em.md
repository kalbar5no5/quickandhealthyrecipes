These Sugar-free and eggless banana muffins are great for breakfast, snack, or dessert. The recipe uses the natural sweetness of ripe bananas and a little honey for extra sweetness. Eggless baking is very common in India as many pure vegetarians don&#39;t take eggs in cakes and bread too. Place wet ingredients including the &#34;egg&#34; in medium bowl, and stir to combine.

For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!
