Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
