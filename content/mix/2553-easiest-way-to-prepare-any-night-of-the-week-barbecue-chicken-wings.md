Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
