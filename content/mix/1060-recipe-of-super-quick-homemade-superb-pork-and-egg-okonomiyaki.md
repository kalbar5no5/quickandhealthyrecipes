Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
