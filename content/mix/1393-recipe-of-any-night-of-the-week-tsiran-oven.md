How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!
