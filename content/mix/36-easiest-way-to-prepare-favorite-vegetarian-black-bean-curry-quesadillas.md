Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
