Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
