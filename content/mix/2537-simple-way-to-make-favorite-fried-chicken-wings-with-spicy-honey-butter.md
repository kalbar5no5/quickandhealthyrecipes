Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
