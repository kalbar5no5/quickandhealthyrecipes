Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
