Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
