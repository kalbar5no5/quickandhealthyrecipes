Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
