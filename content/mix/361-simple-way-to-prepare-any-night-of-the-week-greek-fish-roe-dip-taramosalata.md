Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
