Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
