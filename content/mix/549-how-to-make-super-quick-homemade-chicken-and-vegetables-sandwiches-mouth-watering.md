Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
