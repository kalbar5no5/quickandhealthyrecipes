Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
