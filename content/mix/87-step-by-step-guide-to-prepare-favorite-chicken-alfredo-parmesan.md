Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
