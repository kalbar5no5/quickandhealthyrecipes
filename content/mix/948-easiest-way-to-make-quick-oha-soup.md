Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
