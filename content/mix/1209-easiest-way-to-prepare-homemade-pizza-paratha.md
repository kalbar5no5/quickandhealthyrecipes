Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
