Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
