Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
