recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the cake.  Preheat oven to 175 degree celsius or 350 fahrenheit.  Grease the cake pan with butter.  Lay parchment paper at the bottom and at the sides as well.  Brush the paper with butter and dust icing sugar over the top.  Swirl to coat every nooks and cranny with the icing sugar."
- "Tap out any excess.  Set aside until ready to use.  Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and add in the white chocolate.  Mix to combine well and until the chocolate has melted.  Set aside until ready to use."
- "In a large mixing bowl, add eggs and sugar.  Using a hand mixer, whip for about 7 mins or until tripled in volume.  Stir limoncello into white chocolate mixture.  Fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.  Once the chocolate mixture has fully incorporated, fold in the flour.  Once the flour has fully incorporated, add in salt and lemon zest."
- "Give it a final fold and transfer it into the prepared cake pan.  Wack into the oven and bake for 20 to 25 mins. Do not bake longer than 25 mins.  The center should be still soft and molten.  Set aside to cool down completely."
- "While the cake is cooling down, prepare the ganache.  Adjust the temperature of the oven to 120 degrees celsius or 250 fahrenheit.  Transfer white chocolate into a heatproof bowl and wack into the oven.  Bake for 10 mins.  Remove the chocolate from the oven and fold to smoothen."
- "It will be very stiff and hard to fold at 1st. Continue folding until smoothen.*  Wack the chocolate into the oven and bake for 10 mins.  Remove from oven, fold and bake.  Continue the process until the white chocolate turns into a caramel color.  *I stopped mine at the 7th interval.*"
- "Fold in the cream in 1/3 portions.  When the cream has fully incorporated, you should get a deep dark caramel color.  Once the cake has completely cool, drizzle in the caramelized white chocolate ganache.  Swirl to level the ganache."
- "Chill in the fridge overnight.  The next day, unmold onto a serving plate or a cake stand.  Sprinkle matcha salt and pomegranate over the top.  Slice and serve.  *To make matcha salt, blitz 1 TBSP of maldon sea salt and 1 TSP of matcha until powdery in a spice grinder.*"

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
