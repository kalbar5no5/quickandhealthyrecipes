Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
