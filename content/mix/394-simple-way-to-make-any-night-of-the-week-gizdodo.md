Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
