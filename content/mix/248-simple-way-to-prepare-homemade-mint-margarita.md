Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
