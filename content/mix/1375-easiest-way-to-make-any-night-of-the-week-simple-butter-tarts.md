Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
