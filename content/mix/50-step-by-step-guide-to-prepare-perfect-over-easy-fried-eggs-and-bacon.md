Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
