Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
