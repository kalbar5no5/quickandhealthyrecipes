Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
