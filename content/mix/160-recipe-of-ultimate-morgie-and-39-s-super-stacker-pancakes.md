Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
