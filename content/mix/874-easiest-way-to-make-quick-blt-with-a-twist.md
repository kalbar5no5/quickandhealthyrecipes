Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
