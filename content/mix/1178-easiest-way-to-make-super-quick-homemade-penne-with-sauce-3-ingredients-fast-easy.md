Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
