Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
