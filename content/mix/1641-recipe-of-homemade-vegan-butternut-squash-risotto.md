recipeingredient:
- "1 cup arborio or other mediumgrained rice you need a starchy rice for risotto unlike the longgrained basmati"
- "2 tablespoon olive oil"
- "1 butternut squash peeled and cut into a 12inch dice"
- "4-5 cups hot vegetable stock you could use water but a stock is far more preferable for better flavour"
- "1/2 cup white wine"
- "1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 tablespoon dried sage"
- "to taste Salt and ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cashew Cheese made by blending together 1/4 cup cashews, 1 tsp nutritional yeast, 1/4 cup of water, and salt to taste (optional)"
- "Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the butternut squash, a pinch of salt, and some ground black pepper."
- "Saute over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes or until the squash starts to soften and caramelize."
- "Turn down the heat to medium. Add the rice and stir it with the squash until it begins to turn opaque, about 1 minute. Season again with salt and pepper."
- "Add the white wine and cook, stirring, until the wine’s almost evaporated."
- "Add 1/2 cup of vegetable stock and stir it in. Once the stock has almost evaporated, add another 1/2 cup. Repeat until the rice is cooked. It took me about 35 minutes. Don’t forget to season again with salt and pepper at the end. You might need more or less stock, and you basically want the rice to be tender yet slightly toothy, or al dente. In other words, you don’t want mushy ride. You also don’t want the rice to be dry and lumpy. It should be smooth and creamy."
- "Now add the cashew cheese, if you’re using it, and stir it in. Immediately add the sage and mix. Turn off the heat."

Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
