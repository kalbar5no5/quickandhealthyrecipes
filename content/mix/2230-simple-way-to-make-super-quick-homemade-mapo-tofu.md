How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
