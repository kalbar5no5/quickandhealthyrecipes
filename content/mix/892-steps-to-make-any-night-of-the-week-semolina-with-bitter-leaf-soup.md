Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
