Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
