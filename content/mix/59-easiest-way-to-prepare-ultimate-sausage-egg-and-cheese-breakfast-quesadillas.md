Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
