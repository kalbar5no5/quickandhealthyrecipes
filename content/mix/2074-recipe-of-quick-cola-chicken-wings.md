Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
