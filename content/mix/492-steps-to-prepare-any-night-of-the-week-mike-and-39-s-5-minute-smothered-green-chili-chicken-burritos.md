Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
