Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
