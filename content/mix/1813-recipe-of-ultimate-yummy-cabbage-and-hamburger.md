Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
