Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
