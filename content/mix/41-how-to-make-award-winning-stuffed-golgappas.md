Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
