Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
