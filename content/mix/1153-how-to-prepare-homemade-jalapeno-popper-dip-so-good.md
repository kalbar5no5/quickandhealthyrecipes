In a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sour cream, shredded cheese, seasoning mix and jalapenos. I looked at the reviews concerning this recipe and decided I would follow the original except for some small modifications. The first answer that came to mind was ranch. I think any sauce that will kind of reduce the heat from the jalapeno poppers is a good match. I looked up sauce for jalapeno poppers and one was a lime cilantro dipping sauce that sounds like it would be good. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
