Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
