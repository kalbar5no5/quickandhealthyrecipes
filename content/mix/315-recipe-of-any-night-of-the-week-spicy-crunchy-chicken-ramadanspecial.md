Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
