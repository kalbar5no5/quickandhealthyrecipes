- "(Ingredients) There are so many. It doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have enough! The point is in how they&#39;re prepared!"
- "(Meat Seasoning) Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and add the seasoning! This is important! Rub the ● seasoning into the meat very well."
- "(A dirty burdock root is not scary!) It&#39;s easy if you use aluminum foil to scrub the burdock like this."
- "(Burdock root) Wash the burdock root well and cut into pieces with diagonal cuts. Soak in water to remove the harsh taste! Change the water occasionally!"
- "(Carrot) Since this was a nice carrot, just chop it up!"
- "(Lotus root) Since lotus root changes color easily, soak it in vinegar water! 1 tablespoon of vinegar + 300ml of water is a nice balance!"
- "(Konnyaku) Boil to get rid of the bad taste!"
- "(Give the konnyaku some shine) Once it has boiled, drain in a colander."

- "Pour in enough water to barely cover the ingredients and bring to a boil. Don&#39;t forget to remove the scum!"
- "Once the scum has been removed to a certain extent, cover with a drop-lid! It&#39;s okay to only remove the scum that you can see! If you do too much, you&#39;ll take away the flavor~"

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
