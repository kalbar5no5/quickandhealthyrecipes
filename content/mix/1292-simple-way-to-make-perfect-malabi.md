There are two ways to make malabi: one is an old-fashioned, rice-flour based version. Modern cooks often prefer to use cornstarch instead. Rice flour is easy enough to make in the food processor - just whirl raw white rice around in it until it is fine, floury particles. Or pick some up at the health food store.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
