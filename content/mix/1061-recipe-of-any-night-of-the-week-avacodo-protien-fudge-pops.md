Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
