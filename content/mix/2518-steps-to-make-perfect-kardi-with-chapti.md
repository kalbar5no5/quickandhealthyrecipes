Kadhi chawal is sour dahi kadhi prepared with curd, besan, masalas and given a tadka of dried red chilly and served with besan pakodas. Goes very well salad, roti and any sabzi. After onion becomes golden brown, add chopped kardai and soaked tur daal. Then add red chili powder, salt, mix well and cook till it is done. Kadhi pakora is often made at our home, but I just could not manage myself to take step by step photos and thats why it took me so long to share this delicious Punjabi kadhi recipe. 

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
