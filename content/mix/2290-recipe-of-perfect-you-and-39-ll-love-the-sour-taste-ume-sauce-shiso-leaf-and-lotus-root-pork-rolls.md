Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
