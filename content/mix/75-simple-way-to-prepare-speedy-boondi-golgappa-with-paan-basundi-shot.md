How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
