Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
