Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
