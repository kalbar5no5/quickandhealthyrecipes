Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!
