Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
