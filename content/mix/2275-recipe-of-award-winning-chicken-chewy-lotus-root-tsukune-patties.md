Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
