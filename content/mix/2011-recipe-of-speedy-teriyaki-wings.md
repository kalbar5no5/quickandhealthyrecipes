Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
