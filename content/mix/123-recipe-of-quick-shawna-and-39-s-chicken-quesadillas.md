Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
