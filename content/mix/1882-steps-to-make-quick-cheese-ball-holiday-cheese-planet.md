Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
