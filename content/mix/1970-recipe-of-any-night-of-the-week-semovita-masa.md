Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
