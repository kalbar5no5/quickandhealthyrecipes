Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!
