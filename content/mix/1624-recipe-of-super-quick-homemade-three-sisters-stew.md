Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
