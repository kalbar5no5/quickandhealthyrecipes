Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
