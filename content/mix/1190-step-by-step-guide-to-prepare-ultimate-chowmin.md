Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
