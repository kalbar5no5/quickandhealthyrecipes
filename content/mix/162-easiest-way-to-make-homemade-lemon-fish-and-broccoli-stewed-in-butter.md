Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
