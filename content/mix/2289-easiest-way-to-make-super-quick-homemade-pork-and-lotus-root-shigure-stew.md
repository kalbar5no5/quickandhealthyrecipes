Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
