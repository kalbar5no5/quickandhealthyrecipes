Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
