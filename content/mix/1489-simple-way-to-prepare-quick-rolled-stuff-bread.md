Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
