Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
