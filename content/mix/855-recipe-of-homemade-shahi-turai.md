Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
