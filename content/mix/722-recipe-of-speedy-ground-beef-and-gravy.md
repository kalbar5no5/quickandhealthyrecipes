Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
