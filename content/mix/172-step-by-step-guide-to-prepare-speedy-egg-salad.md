How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
