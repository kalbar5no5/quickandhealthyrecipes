Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
