Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
