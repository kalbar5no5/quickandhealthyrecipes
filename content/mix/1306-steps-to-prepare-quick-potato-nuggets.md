Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
