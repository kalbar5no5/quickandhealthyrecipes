Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
