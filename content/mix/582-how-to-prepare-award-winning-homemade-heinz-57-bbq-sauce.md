Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
