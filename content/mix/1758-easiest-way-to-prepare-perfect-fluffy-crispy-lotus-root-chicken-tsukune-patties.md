How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
