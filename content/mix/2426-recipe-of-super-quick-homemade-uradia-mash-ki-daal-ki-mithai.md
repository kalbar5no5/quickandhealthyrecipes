Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
