Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
