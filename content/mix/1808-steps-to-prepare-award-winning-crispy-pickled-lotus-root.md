With a refreshing and piquant taste, this vinegared dish is great as a palette cleanser between heavily seasoned foods.

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
