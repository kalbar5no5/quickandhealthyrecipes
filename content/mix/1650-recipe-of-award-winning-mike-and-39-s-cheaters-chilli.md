Start with 1 tablespoon to your simmer, mix, taste, then add additional chili powder 1 teaspoon at a time until you&#39;ve reached an acceptable level. Do the same with your Baking Soda [only if your chili has a metallic aftertaste] but 1/4 teaspoon by 1/4 teaspoon."

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
