Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
