Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
