Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
