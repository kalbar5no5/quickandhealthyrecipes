They range from the well-known Pork and Prawn Roll to a simpler Shredded Pork Roll. Bo Bia, on the other hand, is a variation that uses carrots, jicama, Chinese sausages and dried shrimp. To roll, start with mint, a small piece of lettuce to cover the length. Add jicama and carrot, egg, shrimp, and sausages. I was determined to make a plumper roll so I loaded up on the filling. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
