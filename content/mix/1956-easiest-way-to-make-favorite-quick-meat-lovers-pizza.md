Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body.
