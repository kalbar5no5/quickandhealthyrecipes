Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
