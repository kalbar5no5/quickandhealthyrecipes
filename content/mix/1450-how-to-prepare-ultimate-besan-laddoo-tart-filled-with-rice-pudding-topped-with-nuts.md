Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
