Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
