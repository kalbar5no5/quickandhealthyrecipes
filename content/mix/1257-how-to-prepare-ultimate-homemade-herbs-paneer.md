Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
