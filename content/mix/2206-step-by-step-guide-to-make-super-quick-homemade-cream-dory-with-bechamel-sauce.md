Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
