Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
