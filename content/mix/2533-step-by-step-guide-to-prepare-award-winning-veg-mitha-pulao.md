Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them.

These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest.
