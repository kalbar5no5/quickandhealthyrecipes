Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
