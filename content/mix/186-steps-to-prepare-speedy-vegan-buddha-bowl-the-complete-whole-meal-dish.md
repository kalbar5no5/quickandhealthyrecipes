Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them.
