Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
