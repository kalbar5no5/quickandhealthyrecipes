Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
