Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
