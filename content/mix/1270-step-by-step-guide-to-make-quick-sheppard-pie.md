The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body.
