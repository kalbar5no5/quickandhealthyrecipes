Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
