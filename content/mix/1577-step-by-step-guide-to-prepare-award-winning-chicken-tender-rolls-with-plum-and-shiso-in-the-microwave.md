Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
