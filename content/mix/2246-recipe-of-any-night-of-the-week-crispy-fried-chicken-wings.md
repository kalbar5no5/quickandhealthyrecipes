Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
