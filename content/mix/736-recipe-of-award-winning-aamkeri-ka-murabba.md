Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
