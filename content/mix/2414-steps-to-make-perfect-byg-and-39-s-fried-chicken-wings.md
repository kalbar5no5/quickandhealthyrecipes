Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
