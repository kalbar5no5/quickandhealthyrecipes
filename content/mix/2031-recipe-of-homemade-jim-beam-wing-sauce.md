Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
