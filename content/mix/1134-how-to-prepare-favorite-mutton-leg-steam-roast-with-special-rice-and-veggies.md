How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
