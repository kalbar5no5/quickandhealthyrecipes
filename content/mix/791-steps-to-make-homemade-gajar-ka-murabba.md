Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
