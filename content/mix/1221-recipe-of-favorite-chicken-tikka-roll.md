Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
