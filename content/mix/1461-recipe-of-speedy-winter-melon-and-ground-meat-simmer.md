Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
