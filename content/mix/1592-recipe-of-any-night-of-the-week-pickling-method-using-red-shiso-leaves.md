Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
