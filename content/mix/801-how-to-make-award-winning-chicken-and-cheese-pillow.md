Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
