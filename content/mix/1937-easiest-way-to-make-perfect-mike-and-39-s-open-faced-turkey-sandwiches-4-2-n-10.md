Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
