Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
