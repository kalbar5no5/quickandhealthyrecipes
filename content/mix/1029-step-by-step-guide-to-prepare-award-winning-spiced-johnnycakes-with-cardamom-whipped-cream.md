Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
