Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
