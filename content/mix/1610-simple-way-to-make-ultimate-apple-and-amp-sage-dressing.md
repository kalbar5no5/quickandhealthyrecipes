Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
