Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
