In a large bowl or in the rice cooker bowl, combine the cooked rice, bacon and scrambled eggs. Add liquid amino acids or soy sauce and sugar to taste. Octopus is the key ingredient to make &#39;Takoyaki&#39; but Octopus is hard to find where I live. Then, using the same ingredients, I created this savoury cake mixture. Using the porridge setting and the timer on my Zojirushi rice cooker, I cook steel cut oats into a creamy porridge overnight. 

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
