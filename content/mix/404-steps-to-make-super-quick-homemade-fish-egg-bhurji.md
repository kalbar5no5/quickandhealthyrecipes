Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
