Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
