Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
