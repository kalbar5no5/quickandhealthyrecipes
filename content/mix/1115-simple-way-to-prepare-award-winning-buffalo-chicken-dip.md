Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
