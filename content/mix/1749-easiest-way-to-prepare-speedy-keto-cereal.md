Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
