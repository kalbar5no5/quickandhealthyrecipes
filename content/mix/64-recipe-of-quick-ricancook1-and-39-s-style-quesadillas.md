Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
