Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
