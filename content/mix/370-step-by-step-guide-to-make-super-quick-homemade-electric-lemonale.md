Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
