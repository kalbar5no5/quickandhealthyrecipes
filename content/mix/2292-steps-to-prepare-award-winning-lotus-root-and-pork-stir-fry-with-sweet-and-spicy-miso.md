Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
