Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
