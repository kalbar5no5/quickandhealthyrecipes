Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
