Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
