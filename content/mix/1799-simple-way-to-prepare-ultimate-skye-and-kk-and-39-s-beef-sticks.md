Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!
