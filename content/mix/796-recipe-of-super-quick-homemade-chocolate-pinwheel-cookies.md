Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
