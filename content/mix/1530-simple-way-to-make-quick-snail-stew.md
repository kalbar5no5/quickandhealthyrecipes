Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
