Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
