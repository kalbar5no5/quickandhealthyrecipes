Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
