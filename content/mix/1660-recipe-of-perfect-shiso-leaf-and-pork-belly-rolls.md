Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
