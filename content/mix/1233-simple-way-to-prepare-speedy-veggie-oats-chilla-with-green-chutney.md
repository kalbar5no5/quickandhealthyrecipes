Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
