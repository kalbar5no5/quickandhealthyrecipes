Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
