Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
