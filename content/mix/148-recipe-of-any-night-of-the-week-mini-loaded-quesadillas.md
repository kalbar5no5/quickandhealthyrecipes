Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
