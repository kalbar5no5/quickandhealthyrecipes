Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
