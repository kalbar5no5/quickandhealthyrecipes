Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
