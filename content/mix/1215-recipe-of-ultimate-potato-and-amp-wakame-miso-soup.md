Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
