Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
