Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
