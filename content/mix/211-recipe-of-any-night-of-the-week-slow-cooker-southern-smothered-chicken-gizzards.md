Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
