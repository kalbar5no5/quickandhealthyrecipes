Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
