Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
