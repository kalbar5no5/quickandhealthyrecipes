Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
