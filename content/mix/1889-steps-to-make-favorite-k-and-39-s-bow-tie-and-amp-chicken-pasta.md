Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
