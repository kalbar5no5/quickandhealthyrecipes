Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
