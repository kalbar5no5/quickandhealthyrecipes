Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
