Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
