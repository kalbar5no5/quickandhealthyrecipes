Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
