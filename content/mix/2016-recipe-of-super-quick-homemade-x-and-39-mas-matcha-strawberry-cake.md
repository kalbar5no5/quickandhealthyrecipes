Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
