Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
