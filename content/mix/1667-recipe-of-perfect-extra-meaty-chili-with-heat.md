How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
