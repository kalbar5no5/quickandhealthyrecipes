For me, it all depends on the quantity served and what accompanies it. I fry and dry in serviettes because there is so much oil in them after frying. Another method I love is baking Irish potatoes in an oven. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
