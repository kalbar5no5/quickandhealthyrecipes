Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
