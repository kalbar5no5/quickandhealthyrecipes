Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
