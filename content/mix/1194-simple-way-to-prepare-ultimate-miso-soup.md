Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
