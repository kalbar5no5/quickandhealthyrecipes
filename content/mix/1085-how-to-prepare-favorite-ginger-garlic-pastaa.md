Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
