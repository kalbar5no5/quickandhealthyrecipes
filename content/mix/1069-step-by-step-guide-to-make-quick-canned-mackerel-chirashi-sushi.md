Canned mackerel has a flavor that&#39;s milder than sardines or anchovies, while still possessing plenty of savory umami goodness. And since mackerel is a fattier fish than tuna, it turns especially. Surprisingly, the most popular types of Chirashi Sushi in Japan actually contain no meat. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
