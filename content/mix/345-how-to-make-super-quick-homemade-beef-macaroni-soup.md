The beef and macaroni soup are simple and hearty to make as the weather starts to get cooler. There&#39;s beef, tomatoes, macaroni, broth, and spices in this dish that makes it kid-friendly. It reminds me of a different version of chili, but without the beans and instead with macaroni pasta. Add condensed cream of tomato soup, diced tomatoes with their juice, beef broth and water. Bring to a boil, add pasta. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
