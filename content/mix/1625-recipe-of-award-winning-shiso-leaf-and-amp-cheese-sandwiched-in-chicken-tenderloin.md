Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
