Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
