Shawarma is one of my favorite Middle Eastern food preparations. It&#39;s really street food consisting of meat, chicken or even vegetables in a spicy marinade and served in a pita with various toppings. So, it&#39;s basically Middle Eastern tacos. Cook on medium heat for a minute, flip, cook for another minute, cover and reduce the heat to low.

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
