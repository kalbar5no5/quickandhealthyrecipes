Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
