Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
