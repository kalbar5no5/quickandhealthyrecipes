How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
