Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
