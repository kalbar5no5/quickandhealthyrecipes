Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
