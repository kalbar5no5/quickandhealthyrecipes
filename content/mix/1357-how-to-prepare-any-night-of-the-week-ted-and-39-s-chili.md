I was back in Albany last summer and got to have Ted&#39;s again while there, and now I have a serious craving for it. Ted&#39;s also sells onion rings, chicken tenders, burgers &amp; hot dogs. Some of the most satisfying chili around is the most basic: a beef and tomato base with a little heat from chiles to create excitement. This recipe calls for a combination of fresh and dried chiles to infuse the dish with an incredible depth of flavor.

Ted&#39;s Hearty Chili This really is best if it&#39;s allowed to simmer for the day and reheated the next day. Also its much easier to make in a large batch. This is ballparked, and I taste as I go.) I don&#39;t care what Texas says about chili (and a few other things)—I use both beans and meat. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
