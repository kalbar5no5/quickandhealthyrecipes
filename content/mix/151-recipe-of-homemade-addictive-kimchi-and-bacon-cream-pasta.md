recipeinstructions:
- "Cut garlic, onion, bacon and kimchi as mentioned in the ingredients."
- "Combine the B ingredients in a bowl."
- "Put 3 liters of water (to cook pasta) in a large pan and turn the heat on. When it&#39;s just about to boil, add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% salt water)."
- "The amount of salt in the boiling water in Step 3 will affect the taste of the pasta, so measure it out properly. When the pasta water comes to a boil, turn the heat down very low to have it ready to go."
- "Put the A ingredients in a cold frying pan, and turn on the heat to low."

- "At the same time, put the pasta in the pasta water you brought to a boil in Step 4. Cook it for 30 seconds to a minute less than the time on the package. The heat should remain set to low."
- "Strain the al dente pasta into a colander, without totally draining off the pasta water. Add the wet pasta with the sauce mixture from Step 2 to the Step 8 frying pan."
- "Turn up the heat to medium-low and mix altogether. When it starts to bubble and thickens, turn off the heat."
- "Don&#39;t overcook it in Step 11. If you overcook it, the sauce will be lumpy. Serve it on a plate, grind black pepper over the pasta, and it&#39;s done. Yummy."
- "Here&#39;s a Cookpad user that made it with chopped green onions on top. I&#39;ve tried it myself, and it was delicious!! So, if you have green onions, please give it a try."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
