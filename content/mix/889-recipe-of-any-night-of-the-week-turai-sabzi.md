Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
