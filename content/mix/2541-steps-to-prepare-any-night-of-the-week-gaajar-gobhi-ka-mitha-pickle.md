Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
