Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
