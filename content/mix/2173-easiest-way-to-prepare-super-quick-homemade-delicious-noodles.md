Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
