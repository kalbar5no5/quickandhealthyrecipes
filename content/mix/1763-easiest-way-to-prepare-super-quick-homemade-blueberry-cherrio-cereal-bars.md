Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
