Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
