Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
