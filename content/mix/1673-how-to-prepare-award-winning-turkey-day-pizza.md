Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
