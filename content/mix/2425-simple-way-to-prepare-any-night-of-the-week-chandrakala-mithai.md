Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
