Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
