Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
