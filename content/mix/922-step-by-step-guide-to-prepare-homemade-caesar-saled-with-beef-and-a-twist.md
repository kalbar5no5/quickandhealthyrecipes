Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
