How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
