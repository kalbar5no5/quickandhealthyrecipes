Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!
