- "240 grams Strong bread flour"
- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "6 grams Dry yeast"
- "230 grams Milk"
- "20 grams Shortening"
- "1 dash Rice flour for finishing or joshinko or bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the bread dough by mixing all of the ingredients except the shortening and rice flour, and allow it to rise until it doubles in size."
- "Add the shortening when a slightly glutinous film forms on the surface of the dough (At this point, you should be able to see through the dough if you stretch it out thinly enough)."
- "If you use a bread machine, add all the ingredients except the shortening in the baking cake, and start kneading. Then add the shortening after 10 minutes or so."
- "Divide the dough into 10 portions, gently press down on the dough to deflate, and roll them into balls. Allow them to rest for 15 minutes."
- "Gently press down on the dough to deflate, and roll them into balls again. (Place them sealed ends down.)"
- "Allow them to rise (for at least 30 minutes) until they increase to 1.5 times their original sizes. (Proof the dough at 40℃ using the proofing function of the oven. In summer, proof the dough at room temperature.)"
- "Sprinkle with rice flour using a tea strainer. Bake in a preheated oven to 160℃ for 12-13 minutes. (They are done when the bottoms of the rolls are lightly browned.)"
- "If you&#39;d like to serve these as snacks, shake off the excess rice flour and sprinkle with a generous amount of powdered sugar."
- "Make a slit in a roll, but not all the way through, to make a sandwich for breakfast."
- "They also make good snacks when they&#39;re cut in half and topped with a generous amount of maple syrup, honey or jam."
- "They will have a more moist and chewy texture the next day, but if you wrap them in cling film, and microwave for about 20 seconds (500 W), they will feel like they&#39;re freshly baked again."
- "They are also delicious if you brush on an egg wash and bake for 12-15 minutes at 180℃."
- "Or break up a chocolate bar, roll it up in the dough, and drizzle with melted chocolate to finish."
- "The best milk temperature for the dough: About 30℃ for spring and autumn. About 10℃ for summer, and about 45℃ for winter."

Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
