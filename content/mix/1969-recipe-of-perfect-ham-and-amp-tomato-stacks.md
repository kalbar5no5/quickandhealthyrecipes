Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
