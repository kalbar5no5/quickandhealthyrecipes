Submit a Recipe Correction These Borracho beans (&#34;Drunken&#34; beans) are simmered in dark bear to create a bold and flavorful broth with pinto beans, bacon, chilis and spices.

Borracho Beans (or Frijoles Borrachos in Spanish) translates to &#34;drunken beans.&#34; They&#39;re called this because the beans are cooked in beer. But don&#39;t let the name fool you - these beans won&#39;t leave you feeling boozy. That&#39;s right, today we&#39;re talking drunken beans. Or if I were given the naming rights to this one, which I guess I am, I&#39;d probably go more along the lines of Bacon and Beer Simmered Beans. Whatever you call them, though, these guys have been on my Mexican food cooking bucket list for awhile. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
