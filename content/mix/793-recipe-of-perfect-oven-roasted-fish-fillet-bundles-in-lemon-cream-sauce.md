Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
