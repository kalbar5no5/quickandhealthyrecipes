Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
