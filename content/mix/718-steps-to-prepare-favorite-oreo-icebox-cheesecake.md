Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
