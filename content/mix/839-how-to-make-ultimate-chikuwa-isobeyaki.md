Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
