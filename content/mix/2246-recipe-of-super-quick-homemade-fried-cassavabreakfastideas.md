Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
