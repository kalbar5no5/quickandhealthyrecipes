Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
