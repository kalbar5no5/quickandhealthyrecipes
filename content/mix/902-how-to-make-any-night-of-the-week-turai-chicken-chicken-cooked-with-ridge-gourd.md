Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
