How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
