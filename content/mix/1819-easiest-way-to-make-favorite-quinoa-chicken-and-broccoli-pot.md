How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
