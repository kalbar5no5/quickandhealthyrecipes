Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
