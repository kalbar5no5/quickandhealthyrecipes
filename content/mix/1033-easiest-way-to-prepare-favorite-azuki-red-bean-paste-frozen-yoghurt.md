Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
