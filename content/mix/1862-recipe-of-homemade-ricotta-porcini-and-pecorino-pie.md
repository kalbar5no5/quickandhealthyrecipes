Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
