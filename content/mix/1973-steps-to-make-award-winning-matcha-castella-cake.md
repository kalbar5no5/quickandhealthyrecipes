Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
