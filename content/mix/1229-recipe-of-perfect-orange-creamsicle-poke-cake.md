Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
