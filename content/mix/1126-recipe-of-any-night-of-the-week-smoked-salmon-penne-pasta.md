Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
