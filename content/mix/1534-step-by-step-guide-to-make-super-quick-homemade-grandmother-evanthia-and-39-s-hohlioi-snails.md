Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
