Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
