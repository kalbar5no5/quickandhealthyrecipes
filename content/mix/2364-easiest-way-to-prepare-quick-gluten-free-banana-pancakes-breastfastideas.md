Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
