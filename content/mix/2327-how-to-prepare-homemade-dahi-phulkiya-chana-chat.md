Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
