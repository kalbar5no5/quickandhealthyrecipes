Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
