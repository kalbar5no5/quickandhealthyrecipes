Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
