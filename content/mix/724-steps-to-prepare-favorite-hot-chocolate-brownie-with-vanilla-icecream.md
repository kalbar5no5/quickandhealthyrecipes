Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
