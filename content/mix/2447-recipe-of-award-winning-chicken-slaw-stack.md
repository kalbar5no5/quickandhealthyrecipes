Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
