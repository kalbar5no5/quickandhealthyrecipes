Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
