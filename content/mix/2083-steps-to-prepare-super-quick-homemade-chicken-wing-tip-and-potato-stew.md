Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
