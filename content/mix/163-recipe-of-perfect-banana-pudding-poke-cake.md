Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!
