Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
