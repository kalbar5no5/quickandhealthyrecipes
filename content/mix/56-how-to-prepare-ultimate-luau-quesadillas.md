Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
