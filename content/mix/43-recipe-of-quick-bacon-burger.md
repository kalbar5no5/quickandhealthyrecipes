Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
