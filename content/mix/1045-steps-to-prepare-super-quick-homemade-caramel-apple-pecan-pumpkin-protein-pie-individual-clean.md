Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
