Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
