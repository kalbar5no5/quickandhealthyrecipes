Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
