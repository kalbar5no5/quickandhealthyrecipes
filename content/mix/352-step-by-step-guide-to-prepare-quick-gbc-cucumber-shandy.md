Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
