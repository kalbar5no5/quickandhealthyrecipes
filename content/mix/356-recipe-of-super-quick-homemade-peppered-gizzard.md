Wash gizzards (remove the green parts and fats) into a pot and pre boil(I always pre boil offals to remove the excess blood and impurities) After preboiling and washing, season with salt, dry pepper, Knorr, thyme, curry, and onion wedges There is really nothing special about cooking gizzard, you just want it soft and tasty so you can use the same technique employed when cooking chicken or beef. 

Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
