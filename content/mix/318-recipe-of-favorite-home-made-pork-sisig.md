Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!
