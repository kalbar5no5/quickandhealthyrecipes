Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
