Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
