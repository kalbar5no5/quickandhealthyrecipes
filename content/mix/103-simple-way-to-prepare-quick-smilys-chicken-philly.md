Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
