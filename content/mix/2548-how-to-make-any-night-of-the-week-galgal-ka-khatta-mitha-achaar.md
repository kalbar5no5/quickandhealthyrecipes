Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
