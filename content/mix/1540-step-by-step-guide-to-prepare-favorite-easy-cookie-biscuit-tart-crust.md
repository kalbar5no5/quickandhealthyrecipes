Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, easy cookie/biscuit tart crust. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Cookie crumb crusts are a variation on graham cracker crusts, which require a bit more butter to make the right consistency. Use graham crackers, Oreos, lemon cookies, sugar cookies, gingersnaps, chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies or shortbread. Any crispy cookie will work; the possibilities are endless. These cookies are the answer to using up leftover pie crust scraps, but be prepared: They&#39;ve become such a hit with my daughters that I often whip up homemade pie crust dough just to bake a batch.

Easy Cookie/Biscuit Tart Crust is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. They are nice and they look fantastic. Easy Cookie/Biscuit Tart Crust is something which I've loved my entire life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have easy cookie/biscuit tart crust using 2 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Easy Cookie/Biscuit Tart Crust:

1. Get 80 grams Biscuits or cookies
1. Take 40 grams Butter


Pie crust, while also buttery and not too sweet, tends to have more of a flaky texture, while tart crust is more like a cookie. And honestly, tart crust is WAY easier to make! Crisp, lightly sweet, and buttery, this classic pastry crust is an elegant base on which to build an entire repertoire of tarts. It&#39;s easier to make than flaky pie pastry, too—just stir melted butter with sugar and a bit of salt, then blend in all-purpose flour to form the dough.

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
