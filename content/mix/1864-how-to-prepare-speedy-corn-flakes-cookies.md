Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
