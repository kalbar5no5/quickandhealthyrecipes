Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
