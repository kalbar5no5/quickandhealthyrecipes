Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
