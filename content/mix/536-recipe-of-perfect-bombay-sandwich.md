Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
