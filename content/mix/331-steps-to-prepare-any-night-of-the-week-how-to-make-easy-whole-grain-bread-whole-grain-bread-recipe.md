Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
