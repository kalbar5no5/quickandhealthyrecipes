Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
