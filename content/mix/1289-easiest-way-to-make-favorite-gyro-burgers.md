Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
