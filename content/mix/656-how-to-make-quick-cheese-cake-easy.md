Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood.

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!
