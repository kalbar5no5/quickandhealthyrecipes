Place ketchup, mustard or barbecue sauce in a small resealable plastic bag; snip one corner. Pipe eyes on each mummy dog. Wrap the crescent roll dough strips around hot dogs, leaving room near the top for the mummy face. Just before serving, squirt a little mustard on a plate. Dip a toothpick in the mustard and use it to make a mummy face on the hot dogs. 

Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
