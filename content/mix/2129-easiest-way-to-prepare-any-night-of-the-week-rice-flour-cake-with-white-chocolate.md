Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
