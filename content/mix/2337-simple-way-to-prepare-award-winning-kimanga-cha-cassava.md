Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
