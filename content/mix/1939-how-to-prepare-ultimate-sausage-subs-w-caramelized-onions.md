Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
