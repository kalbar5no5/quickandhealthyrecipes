Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
