Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine.
