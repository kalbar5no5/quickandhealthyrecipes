Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
