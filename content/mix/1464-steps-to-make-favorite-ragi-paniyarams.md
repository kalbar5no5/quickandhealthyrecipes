How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
