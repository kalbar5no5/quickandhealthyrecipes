How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
