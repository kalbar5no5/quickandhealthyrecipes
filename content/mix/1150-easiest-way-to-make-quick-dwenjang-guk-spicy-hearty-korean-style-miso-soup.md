You can then freeze the greens for future use, or refrigerate them for 2 to 3 weeks before using."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
