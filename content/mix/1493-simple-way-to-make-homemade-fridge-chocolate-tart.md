Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
