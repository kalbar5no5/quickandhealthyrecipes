How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
