Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
