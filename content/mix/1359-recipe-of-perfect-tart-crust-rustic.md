Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
