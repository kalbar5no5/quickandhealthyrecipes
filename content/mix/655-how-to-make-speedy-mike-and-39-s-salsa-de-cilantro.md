However, what you like is the right way to use it. I was looking for a really good Pico de Gallo salsa. I came upon this fabulous Chilean version (Pebre) in the Moosewood cookbook. Apparently this is Chile&#39;s most popular side dish and is served with every meal. Awesome just with chips or with anything you&#39;d serve with salsa. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
