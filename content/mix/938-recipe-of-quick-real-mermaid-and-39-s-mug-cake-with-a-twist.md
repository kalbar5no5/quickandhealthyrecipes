Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
