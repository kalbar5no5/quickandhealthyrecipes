How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
