Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
