Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
