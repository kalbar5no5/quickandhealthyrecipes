Protein is an essential micronutrient required to build muscle mass, and it is chained together with smaller building blocks called amino acids. Having a protein-rich diet every day is a must, as our body cannot generate it on its own. The protein foods group includes seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
