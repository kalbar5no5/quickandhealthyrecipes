Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
