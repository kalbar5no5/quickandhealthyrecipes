How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
