Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
