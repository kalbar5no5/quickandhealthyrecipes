recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the 2 slices of raisin bread. You may toast them using a toaster. I toast them using a pan. Lay the 2 slices of bread on the pan and switch the fire to low. 2.5 minutes later, flip the bread over to toast the other sides for 2.5 minutes."
- "Cut the 3 sausages in half."
- "Heat the now 6 pieces of sausages and 6 slices of ham on the pan over low heat. The ham is ready when the sides curl up a little. Roll the sausages occasionally to avoid burning them."
- "Crack 4 eggs into a bowl. Add a teaspoon of salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs well for 1 minute. You should see some bubbles on the surface of the bowl at the end of the beating."
- "Oil the pan with 2 teaspoon of olive oil. Heat the pan over low heat. Gently pour the eggs into the pan. 10 seconds later gently scrape the bottom of the egg mixture from one corner to the corner across it (diagonally) using a spatula. Repeat this for different corners with an interval of 5 seconds. Once all the egg mixture has been turned to scrambled eggs, switch off the fire immediately and bring the pan to cool (lift it away from the stove) to avoid having the eggs cooked any further."
- "Place the scrambled eggs on top of each toasted raisin bread. Add a dash a pepper on the eggs."
- "Slice 1 tomato into 6-8 pieces."
- "Open up a can of baked beans. Pour half of the beans and sauce for each plate of breakfast."

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats.

These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body.
