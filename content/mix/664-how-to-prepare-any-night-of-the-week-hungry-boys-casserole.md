Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
