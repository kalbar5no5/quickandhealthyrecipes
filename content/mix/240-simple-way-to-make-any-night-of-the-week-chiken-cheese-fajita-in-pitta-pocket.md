Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
