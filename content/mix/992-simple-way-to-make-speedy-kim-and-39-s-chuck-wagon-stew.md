Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
