Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
