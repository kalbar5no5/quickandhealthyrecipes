How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
