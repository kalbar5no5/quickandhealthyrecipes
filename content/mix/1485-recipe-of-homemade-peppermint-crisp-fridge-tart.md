Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
