Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
