Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
