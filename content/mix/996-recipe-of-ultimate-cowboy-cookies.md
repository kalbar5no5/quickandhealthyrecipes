Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
