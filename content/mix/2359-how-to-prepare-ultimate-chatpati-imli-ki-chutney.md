Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
