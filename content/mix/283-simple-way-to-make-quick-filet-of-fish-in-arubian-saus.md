Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
