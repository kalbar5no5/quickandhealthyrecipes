Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
