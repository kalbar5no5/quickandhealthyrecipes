Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
