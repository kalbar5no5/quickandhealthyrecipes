Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
