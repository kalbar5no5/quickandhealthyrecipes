Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
