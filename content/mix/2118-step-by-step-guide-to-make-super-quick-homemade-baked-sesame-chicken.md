Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
