Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
