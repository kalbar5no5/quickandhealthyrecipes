recipeingredient:
- "1 stick chorizo sausage"
- "3 eggs"
- "8 flour tortillas"
- "2 cups shredded cheese"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro"
- " Sour cream and hot sauce for dipping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add chorizo to pan on medium heat. Use a spatula to work it as it cooks so it resembles ground beef. It comes in tube form but is very easy to work with. It&#39;s not as dense as standard sausages. Cook that for approx. 5 minutes (it cooks fast)"
- "Push the clocked chorizo to one side of the pan. Crack the 3 eggs into the open side of the pan. Begin scrambling them in the pan for a minute then begin to stir them into the sausage. Continue blending till none of the egg is runny. Again, it cooks fast so it&#39;ll probably only take a couple minutes. Remove mixture to a bowl."
- "Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Take a tortilla, add a thin layer of shredded cheese, sprinkle some fresh cilantro on the cheese, add a layer of chorizo/egg and another layer of cheese. Leave about 1/2 inch space between ingredients and the edge of the tortilla. Put that directly in pan, tortilla side down, on low heat. Top with another tortilla. Cook for a few minutes while moving it around in the pan for an even cook. Flip. Repeat. Continue that process till all ingredients are used. Cut in half or quarters. 1 stick of sausage and 3 eggs gave me 4 quesadillas."
- "A dipping sauce is a good idea. I just mixed about 3 parts sour cream and 1 part hot sauce in a separate bowl. You can even throw a bit of the cilantro in that too. I always get the hot chorizo as opposed to the mild because cooking it with the egg cuts down a lot of the heat. Hence the hot sauce. Enjoy!"

Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
