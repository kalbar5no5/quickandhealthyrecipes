Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
