Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
