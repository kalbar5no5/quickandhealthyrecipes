Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
