Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
