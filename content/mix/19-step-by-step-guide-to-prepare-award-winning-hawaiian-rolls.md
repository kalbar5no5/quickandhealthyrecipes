Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
