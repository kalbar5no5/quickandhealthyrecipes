Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
