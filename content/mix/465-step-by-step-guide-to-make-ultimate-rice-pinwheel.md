Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body.
