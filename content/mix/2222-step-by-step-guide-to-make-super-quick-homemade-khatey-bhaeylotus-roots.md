How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
