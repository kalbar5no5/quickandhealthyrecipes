Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
