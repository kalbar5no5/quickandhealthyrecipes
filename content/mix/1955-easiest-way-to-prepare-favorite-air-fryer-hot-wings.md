Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
