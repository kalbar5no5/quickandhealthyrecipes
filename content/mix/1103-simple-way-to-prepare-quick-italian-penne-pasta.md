Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
