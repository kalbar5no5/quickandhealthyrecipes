Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
