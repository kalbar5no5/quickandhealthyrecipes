We work directly with farms to bring you fresh produce that&#39;s unparalleled when it comes to quality, tastiness and variety. Fresh ginger and red pepper flakes add welcome zing, but the real surprise here is napa (aka Chinese) cabbage.

Spinach has tons of vitamin A (over half of the recommended daily amount in a serving!), which helps boost and enhance our immune system â€” so make like Popeye and add this leafy green to your diet.

Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
