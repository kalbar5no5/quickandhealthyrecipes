Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
