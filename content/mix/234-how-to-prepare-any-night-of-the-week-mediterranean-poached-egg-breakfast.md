Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
