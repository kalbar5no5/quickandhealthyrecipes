Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
