Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
