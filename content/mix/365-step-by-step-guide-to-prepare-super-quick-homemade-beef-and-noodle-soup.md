Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
