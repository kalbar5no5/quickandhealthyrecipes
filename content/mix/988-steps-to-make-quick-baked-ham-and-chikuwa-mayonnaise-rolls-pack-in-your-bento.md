Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
