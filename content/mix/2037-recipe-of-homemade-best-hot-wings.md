Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
