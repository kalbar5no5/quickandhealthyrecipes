Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
