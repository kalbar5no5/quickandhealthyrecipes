Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
