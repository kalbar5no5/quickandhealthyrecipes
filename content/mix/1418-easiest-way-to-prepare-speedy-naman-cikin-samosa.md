Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
