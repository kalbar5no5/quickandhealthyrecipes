How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
