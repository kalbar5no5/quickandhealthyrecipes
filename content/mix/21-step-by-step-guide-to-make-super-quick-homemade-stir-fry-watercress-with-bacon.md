How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
