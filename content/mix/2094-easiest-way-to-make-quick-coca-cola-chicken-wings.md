Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
