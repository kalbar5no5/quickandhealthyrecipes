Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
