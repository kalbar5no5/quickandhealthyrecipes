How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
