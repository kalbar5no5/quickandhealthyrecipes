Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
