Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!
