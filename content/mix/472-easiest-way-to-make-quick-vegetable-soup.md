Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
