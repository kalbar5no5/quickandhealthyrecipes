Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
