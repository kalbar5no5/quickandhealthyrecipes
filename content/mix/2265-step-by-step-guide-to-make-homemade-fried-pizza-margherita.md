Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
