How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
