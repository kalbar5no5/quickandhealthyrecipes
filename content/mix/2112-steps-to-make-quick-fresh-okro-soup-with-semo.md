Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
