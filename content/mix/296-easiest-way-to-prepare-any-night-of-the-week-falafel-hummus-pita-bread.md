Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
