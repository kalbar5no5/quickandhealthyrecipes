Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
