Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
