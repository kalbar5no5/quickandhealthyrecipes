Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
