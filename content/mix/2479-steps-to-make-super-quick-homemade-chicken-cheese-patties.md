Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
