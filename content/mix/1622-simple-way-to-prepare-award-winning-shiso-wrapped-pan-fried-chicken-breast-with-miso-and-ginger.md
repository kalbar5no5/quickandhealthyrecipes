- "1 tbsp Miso"
- "1 tsp Grated ginger"
- "8 to 10 Shiso leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the chicken 1cm thick. Combine the ◆ ingredients, and put them with the chicken in a plastic bag. Massage the meat over the bag. Leave to marinate in the refrigerator for about an hour."
- "Put some vegetable oil in a frying pan and pan fry the marinated chicken pieces, over low heat since it burns easily."
- "Turn the chicken pieces over, cover with a lid and cook through. Take the lid off and raise the heat to medium to brown the surface. When the chicken is browned, take it out onto a plate."
- "Turn the heat off and spread out the shiso leaves. Put a piece of chicken on one half of each leaf. Wrap the leaf around the chicken and flip it over to stick the leaf onto each side."
- "The leaves should stick with just the residual heat in the frying pan, but if it doesn&#39;t, just cook it over low heat until it does."
- "Plate and serve."
- "This depends on what you prefer, but we take the skin off as well as any excess fat on the chicken breast with kitchen scissors, to make this a healthy dish. We&#39;re concerned about middle aged spread."

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
