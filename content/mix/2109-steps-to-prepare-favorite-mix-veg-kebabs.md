Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
