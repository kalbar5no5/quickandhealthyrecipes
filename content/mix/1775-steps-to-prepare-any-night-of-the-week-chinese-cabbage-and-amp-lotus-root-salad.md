Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at combating depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
