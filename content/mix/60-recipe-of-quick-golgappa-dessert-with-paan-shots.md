Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
