Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
