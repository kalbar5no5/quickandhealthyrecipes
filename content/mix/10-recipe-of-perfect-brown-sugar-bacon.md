Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
