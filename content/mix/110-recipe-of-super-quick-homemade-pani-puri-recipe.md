Paani poori in Maharashtra, Golgappe in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab while Puchka in West Bengal and Gupchup in parts of Odisha. The pani puri water is what binds all the components together and makes the filling-filled puris such a fun experience! I make my version of jaljeera with a host of spices and seasonings that boost the flavour of the pani. It is all about getting the balance right for a sweet, spicy, tangy, and sour pani. You can customise it according to your taste preferences. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
