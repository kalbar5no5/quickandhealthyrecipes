How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
