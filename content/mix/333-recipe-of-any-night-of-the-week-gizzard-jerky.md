Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
