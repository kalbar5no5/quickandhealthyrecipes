Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
