Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
