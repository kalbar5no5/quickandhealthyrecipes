Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
