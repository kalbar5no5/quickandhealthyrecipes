Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
