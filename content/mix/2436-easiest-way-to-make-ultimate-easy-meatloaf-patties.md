Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
