Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
