Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
