How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
