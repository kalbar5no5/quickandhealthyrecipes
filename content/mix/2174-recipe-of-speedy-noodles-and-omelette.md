Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
