Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
