Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
