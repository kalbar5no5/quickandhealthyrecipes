Wawa hoagies are at their best when you keep it simple. And the standard-issue ham hoagie with all normal vegetables, salt, pepper and oil is a damn fine sandwich. If you are gutting your hoagie roll, you have to stop. If you want to gut your Subway sandwich, that&#39;s fine. But if you are building a real deal hoagie, you have to keep all that bread right where it is. 

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
