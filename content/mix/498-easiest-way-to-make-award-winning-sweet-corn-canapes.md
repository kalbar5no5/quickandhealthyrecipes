Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
