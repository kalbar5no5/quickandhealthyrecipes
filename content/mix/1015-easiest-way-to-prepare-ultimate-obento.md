Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
