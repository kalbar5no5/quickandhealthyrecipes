Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
