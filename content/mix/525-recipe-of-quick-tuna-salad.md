Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
