Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
