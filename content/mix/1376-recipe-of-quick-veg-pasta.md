Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin.

Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine.
