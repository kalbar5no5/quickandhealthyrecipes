Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
