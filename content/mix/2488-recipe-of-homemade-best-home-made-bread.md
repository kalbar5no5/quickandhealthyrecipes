recipeingredient:
- "3 tbsp yeast"
- "2 1/2 tbsp honey or 3 tbs white sugar"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "3 eggs"
- "3/4 cup melted coconut oil or canola vegetable or olive oil"
- "5 cup warm water"
- "6 cup whole wheat flour"
- "2 tbsp salt"
- "6 cup white flour 6 cups"
- "1 cup shredded flax seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast, honey and 1 cup warm water. Let stand for 10 minutes."
- "Add flax seeds, eggs, and oil and mix well."
- "Add 5 cups of warm water and whole wheat flour. Mix well."
- "Add salt and mix well."
- "Add white flour one cup at a time, mixing well each time. Add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is soft and kneadable."
- "Take dough and divide into six equal sections. Form a loaf with each section."
- "Place loafs in oiled loaf pans and poke a few holes in a nice pattern with a knife (this allows the dough to rise without forming air pockets)."
- "Cover with clean towel and let rise until at least doubled their size in a warm place. (Letting them sit for 7-10 minutes in the oven on &#34;warm&#34; setting, covered with a towel, will help them rise better). After the 7-10 minutes take them out and let them rise on the counter until they are the appropriate size."
- "Bake at 350°F until golden brown."
- "I always mix and knead the dough in my Bosch machine and then bake in the oven. Much easier and yields much fluffier bread."
- "After the bread is baked, take them out of the pans immediately and let cool. Slice the bread. Place loafs in ziploc bags. Because this recipe yields 6 loafs, I usually freeze 5 and just take them out as needed, defrosting and storing them in the refrigerator. Pop them in the toaster and they still taste fresh as ever. :)"

How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
