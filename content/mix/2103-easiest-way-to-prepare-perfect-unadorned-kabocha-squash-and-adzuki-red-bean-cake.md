- "200 grams Pancake mixfor a homemade version or use storebought"
- "250 grams Kabocha squash"
- "70 grams  Raw cane sugar"
- "80 ml  Your choice of vegetable oil"
- "1  Egg"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Soy milk"
- "1 can Cooked sweet adzuki bean paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Microwave the kabocha, then strain to purée or mash until smooth. Add the ★ ingredients to the kabocha and mix well."
- "Add the pancake mix, stir until well incorporated, then add the milk and stir until the batter becomes thick. Adjust the amount of milk depending on the water content of the kabocha."
- "Scoop 3 tablespoons of adzuki bean paste from the can, and add 3 tablespoons of the batter to the can to blend. Set the 3 tablespoons aside for later use."
- "Since I wanted to make this recipe using one bowl, I substituted 1/3 of the amount of adzuki with the batter, which gave it an even more marbled appearance."
- "Pour 1/2 of the batter into the cake mold, divide the adzuki bean paste into 5 to 6 even dollops, then put them on top. Next, pour the rest of the kabocha squash batter on top."
- "Run the back of a teaspoon over the batter in wave-like motions to roughly create a marbleized pattern. If you mix the batter too much, it won&#39;t get the marbleized look, so don&#39;t go overboard."
- "Top the batter with 3 tablespoons of adzuki from Step 3, then bake for 40 to 50 minutes in an oven preheated to 170°C. Adjust the baking time according to your oven."
- "If you have a marbleized pattern of adzuki and kabocha when you cut it, it&#39;s a success! The crispy texture of adzuki topping gives this cake a lovely accent!"

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
