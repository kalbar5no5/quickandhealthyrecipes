Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
