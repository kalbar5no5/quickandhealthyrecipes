Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
