Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
