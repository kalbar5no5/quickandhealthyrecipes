Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
