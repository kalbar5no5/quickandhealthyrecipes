Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
