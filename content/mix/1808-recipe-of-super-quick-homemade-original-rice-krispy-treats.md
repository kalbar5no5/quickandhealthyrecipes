Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
