Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
