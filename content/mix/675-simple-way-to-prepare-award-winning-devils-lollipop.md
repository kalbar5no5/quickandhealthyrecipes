Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
