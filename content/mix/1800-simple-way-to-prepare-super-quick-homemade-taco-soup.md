Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
