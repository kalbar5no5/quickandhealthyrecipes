Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
