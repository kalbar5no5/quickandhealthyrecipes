Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Allow the rice to continue cooking until the rice is soft. If it is not dry at this point, then switch the heat to low to allow it to dry the excess water without making the rice much softer.

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
