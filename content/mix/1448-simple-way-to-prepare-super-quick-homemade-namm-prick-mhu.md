Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
