Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
