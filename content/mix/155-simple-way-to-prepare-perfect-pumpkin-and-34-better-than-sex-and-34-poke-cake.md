Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
