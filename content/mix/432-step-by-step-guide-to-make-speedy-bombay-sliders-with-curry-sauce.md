How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
