Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
