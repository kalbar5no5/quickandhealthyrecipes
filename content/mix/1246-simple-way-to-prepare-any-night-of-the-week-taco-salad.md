When there&#39;s not much time to make something taco salad is a great option, especially this version which uses ground beef (no dicing up chicken or beef), bottled salsa to add lots of flavor without the prep, and pre-shredded cheese. An easy taco salad is even simpler than those, and it&#39;s still packed with all your favorite Mexican flavors. The smoky seasoned browned beef, juicy grape tomatoes, creamy avocado and sour cream, crispy Romaine lettuce, sharp cheddar cheese, and spicy (or mild!) salsa are all combined to perfection. 

Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
