Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
