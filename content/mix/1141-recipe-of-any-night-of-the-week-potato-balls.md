Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are fantastic at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
