Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
