Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
