Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
