Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
