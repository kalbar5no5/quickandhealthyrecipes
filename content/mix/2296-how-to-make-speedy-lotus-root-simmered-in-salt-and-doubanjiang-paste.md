Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
