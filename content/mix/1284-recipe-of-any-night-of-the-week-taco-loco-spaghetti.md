Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
