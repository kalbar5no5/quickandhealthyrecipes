Use Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
