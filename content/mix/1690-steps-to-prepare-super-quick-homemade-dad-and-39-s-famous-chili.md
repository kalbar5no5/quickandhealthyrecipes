Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
