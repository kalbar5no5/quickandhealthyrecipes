Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
