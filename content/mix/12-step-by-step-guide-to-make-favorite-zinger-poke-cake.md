Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
