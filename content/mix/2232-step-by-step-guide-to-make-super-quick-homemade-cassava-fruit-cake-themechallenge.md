Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
