Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
