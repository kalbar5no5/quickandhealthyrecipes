Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
