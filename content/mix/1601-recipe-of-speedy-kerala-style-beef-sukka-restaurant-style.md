Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
