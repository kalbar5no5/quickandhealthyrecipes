Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
