Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
