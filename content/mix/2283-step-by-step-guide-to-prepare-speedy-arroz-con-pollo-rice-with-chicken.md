recipeingredient:
- "3.5-4 pound chicken cut up and seasoned on both sides with 1  teaspoons kosher salt and 12 teaspoon black pepper"
- " Olive oil or vegetable oil"
- "1 small to medium red bell pepper chopped into  pieces"
- "1 small to medium green bell pepper chopped into  pieces"
- "1 medium yellow onion chopped into  pieces"
- "6-8 cloves garlic peeled and minced"
- "2 medium tomatoes seeded and cored and chopped into  pieces"
- "2 packets GOYA Sazon azafran or 1 Tablespoon achiote or 1 teaspoon crushed saffron threads"
- "6 cups unsalted chicken stock"
- "1 cup water"
- "3 cups long grain rice Uncle Bens"
- "1/3-1/2 cup frozen peas optional"
- " Cilantroparsleygreen onion chopped for garnish optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a 4 or 5 quart Dutch or French oven, preheat 1.5 Tablespoons oil (if using skin-on chicken, 2.5 Tablespoons if skinless) over medium high heat and sear the chicken in two batches, about 3.5 to 4 minutes per side, until each side has a dark golden brown crust on it. Set the chicken aside."
- "In the same pot, add 1 Tablespoon of oil and add your bell pepper, onion, garlic, &amp; tomatoes, and sweat your aromatics until the onion becomes translucent about 5 minutes. Then add the GOYA Sazon azafran or achiote (or saffron) and 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, stirring them in until you can see the azafran or achiote is evenly distributed throughout your sofrito (A term in many Latino/Hispanic cuisines for the savory flavor base made when you sautee a minimum of onion, pepper, and garlic in oil)."
- "Add the chicken back, along with any juices, as well as 2 cups unsalted chicken stock and 1 cup water, give it a stir, and cover the pot to bring the braise to a boil (8 to 10 minutes). When the braise hits a boil, turn the heat down to medium low and simmer, with the lid askew (open about 1 inch on one side) for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Remove the chicken and set aside. Then turn up heat to medium, remove lid, and simmer, uncovered for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will reduce braising liquid a little and concentrate the flavors. Adjust seasoning if needed, and turn off the heat. Then put the chicken back into the pot."
- "At this point, get another 4 or 5 quart pot out for your rice. Put the pot on the burner, turn the heat up to medium high, pour in the 3 cups of rice, 2 cups of the braising liquid from the chicken (I either scoop it right out with a 1 cup measuring cup or ladle it out into a measuring cup, along with some bits of the sofrito), 4 cups of unsalted chicken stock, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt."
- "Stir to combine, taste the seasoning and adjust for salt if desired. You’ll want to cover the chicken back up with the lid while the rice cooks so it’ll stay warm."
- "Cover the pot completely until the rice comes to a boil (check at about 7 minutes), then give it a few gentle stirs, turn the heat down to medium low, and continue to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, fully covered, until all the liquid has been completely absorbed for a good 3 or 4 minutes."
- "Turn off the heat, add the frozen peas to the rice, and fold them into the rice as you fluff it."
- "Plate the rice, then place desired amount of chicken on top, spooning a little bit of the braising liquid over both the chicken and the rice, and garnish with some fresh chopped cilantro/parsley/green onions if desired before serving. The chicken should have remained warm enough for serving, but if not, you can always put it on medium heat about 5 minutes beforehand."

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
