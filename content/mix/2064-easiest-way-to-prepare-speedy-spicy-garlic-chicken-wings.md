How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
