Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
