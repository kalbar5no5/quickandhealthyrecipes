Selepas adanya pertukaran vendor yang berniaga di JKR, tiada lagi gerai yang menjual nasi ayam goreng kunyit. Inna lillahi wainna ilaihi roji&#39;unâ€¦ Tidak ku sangka kepergianmua begitu cepat.

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
