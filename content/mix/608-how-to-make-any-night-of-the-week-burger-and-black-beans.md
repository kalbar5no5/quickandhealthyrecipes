Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
