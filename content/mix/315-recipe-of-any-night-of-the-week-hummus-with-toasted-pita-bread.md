Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
