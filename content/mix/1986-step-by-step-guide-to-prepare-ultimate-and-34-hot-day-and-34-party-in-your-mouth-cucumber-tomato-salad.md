Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
