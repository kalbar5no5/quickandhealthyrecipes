Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
