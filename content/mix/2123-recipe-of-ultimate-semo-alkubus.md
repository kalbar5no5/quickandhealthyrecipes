Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
