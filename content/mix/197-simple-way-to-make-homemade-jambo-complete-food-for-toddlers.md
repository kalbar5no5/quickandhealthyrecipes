Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
