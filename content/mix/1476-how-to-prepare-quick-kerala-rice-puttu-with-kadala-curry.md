Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
