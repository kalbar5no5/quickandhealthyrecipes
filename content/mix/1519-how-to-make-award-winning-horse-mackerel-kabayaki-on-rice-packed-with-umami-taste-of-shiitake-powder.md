Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
