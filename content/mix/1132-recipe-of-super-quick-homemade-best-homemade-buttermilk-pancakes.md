Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
