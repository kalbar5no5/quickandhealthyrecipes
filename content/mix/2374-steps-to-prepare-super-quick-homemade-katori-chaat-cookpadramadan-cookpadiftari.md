Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
