Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
