Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
