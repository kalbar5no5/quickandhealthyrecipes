Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
