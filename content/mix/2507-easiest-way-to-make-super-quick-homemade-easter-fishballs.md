Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
