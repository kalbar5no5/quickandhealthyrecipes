Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
