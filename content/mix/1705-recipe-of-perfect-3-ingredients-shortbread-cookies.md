If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest.
