Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
