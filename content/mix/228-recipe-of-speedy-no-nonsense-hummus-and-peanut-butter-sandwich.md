Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
