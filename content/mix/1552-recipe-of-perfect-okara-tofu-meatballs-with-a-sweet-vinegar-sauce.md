Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
