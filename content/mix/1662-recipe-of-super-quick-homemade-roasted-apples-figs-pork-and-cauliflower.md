Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
