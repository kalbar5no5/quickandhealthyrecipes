Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
