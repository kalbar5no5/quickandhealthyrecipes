Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
