Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
