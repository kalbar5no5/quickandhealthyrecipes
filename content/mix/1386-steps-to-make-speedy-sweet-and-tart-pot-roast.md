Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
