Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
