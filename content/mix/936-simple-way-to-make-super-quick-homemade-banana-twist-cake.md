Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
