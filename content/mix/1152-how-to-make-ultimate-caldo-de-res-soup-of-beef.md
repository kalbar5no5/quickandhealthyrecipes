How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these hints  instead!
