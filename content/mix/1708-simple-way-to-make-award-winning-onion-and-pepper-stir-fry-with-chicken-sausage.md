Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
