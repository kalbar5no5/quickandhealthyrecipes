Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
