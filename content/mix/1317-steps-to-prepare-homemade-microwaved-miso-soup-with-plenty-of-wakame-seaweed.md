Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
