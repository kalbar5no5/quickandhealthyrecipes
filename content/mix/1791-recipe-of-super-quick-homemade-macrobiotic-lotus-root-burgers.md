Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!
