Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
