Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood.

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production.

DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine.
