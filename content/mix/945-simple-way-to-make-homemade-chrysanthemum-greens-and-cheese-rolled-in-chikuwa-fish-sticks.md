How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
