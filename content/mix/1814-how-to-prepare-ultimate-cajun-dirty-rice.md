Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try some of these instead!
