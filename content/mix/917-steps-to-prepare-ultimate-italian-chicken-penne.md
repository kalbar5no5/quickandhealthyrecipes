Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
