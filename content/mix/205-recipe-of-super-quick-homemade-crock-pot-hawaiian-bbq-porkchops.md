How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
