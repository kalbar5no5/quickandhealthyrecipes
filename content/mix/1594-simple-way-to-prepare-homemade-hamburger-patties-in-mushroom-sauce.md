Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on.

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them.
