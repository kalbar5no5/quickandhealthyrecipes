Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
