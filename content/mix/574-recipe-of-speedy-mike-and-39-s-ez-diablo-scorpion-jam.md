Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
