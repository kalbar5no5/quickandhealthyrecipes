Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
