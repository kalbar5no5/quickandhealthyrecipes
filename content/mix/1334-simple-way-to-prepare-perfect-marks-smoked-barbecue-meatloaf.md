Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
