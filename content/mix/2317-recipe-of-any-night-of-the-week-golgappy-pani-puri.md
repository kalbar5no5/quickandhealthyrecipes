Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
