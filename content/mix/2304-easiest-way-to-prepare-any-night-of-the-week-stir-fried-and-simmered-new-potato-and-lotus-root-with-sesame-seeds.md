Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
