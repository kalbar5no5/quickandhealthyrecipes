Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
