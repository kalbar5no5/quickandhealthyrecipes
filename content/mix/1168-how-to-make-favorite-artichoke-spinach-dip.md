Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
