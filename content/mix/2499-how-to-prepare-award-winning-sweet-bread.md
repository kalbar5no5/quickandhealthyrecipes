Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!
