Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
