Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
