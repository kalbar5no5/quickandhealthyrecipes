Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
