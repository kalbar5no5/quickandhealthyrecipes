Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
