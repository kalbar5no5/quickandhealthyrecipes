Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
