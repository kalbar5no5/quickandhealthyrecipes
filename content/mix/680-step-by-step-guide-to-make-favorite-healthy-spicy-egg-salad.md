Made with bright, sunny lightly chopped eggs in a simple mayonnaise dressing, studded with crunchy tidbits of celery and onion, and sprinkled with a few herbs and spices. The perfect egg salad is chunky yet creamy.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook healthy spicy egg salad using 11 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.

The protein in eggs is the most bioavailable source of protein for humans. Fry the eggs until they are crispy brown on the outside, however you don&#39;t want to cook them to long as we want the egg to be soft. When the eggs are cooked, set them aside on some paper towel to soak up any excess oil. Add the eggs to a saucepan and fill with cold water.

When the eggs are cooked, set them aside on some paper towel to soak up any excess oil. Add the eggs to a saucepan and fill with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Take the eggs out of the water and let cool. The two perfect egg salad recipes to me are first, a crunchy curry egg salad and second, a spicy salty egg salad. 

Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
