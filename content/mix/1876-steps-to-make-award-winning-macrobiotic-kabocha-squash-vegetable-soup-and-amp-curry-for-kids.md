Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are terrific at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
