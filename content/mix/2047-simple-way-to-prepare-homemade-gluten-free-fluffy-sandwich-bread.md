Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
