Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
