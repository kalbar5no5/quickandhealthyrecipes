Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
