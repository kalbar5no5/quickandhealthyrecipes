Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
