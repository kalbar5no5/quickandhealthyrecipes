Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
