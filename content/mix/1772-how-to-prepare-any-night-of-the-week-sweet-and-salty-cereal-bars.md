Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
