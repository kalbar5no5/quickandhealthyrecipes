recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread flour"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "30 grams Unsalted butter"
- "140 ml Milk"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast"
- " For Baking"
- "1 Joshinko flour or bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients except the yeast in the bread pan and place the yeast in the yeast compartment. Press the Start button."
- "Baking settings differ depending on the bread machine, so use the setting that allows you to take out the dough after the first rise and shape as you like."
- "When the baking program ends (after the first rise), take out the dough from the bread pan."
- "Weigh the dough, divide into 6 portions, and shape into balls. Note: the dough weighs about 400 g, so make 6 balls weighing around 66 g each."
- "To prevent them from drying out, cover the balls of dough with a damp tea towel. Leave to rest for 10 minutes (allowing the dough to rise)."
- "Deflate the buns by evenly pushing out any air from the dough on a work surface or with the palms of your hands."
- "Reshape the dough into balls and place with the seam side down on a tray lined with a sheet of parchment paper."
- "Cover the dough with plastic wrap, then with a moistened tea towel, and rise at 40°C for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 40°C in advance."
- "After letting the dough rise in the oven for 15 minutes, leave to rise at room temperature for another 10 to 15 minutes. The oven needs to be preheated for baking, so let the bread dough finish rising at room temperature."
- "Preheat the oven to 190°C. Start to preheat the oven as soon as you take out the tray with dough."
- "The dough is finished rising when it has doubled in size. If you want your bread dough to rise at room temperature without using the oven, allow the dough to rise until it looks like this."
- "Sprinkle the top with joshinko flour. Use a tea strainer to sprinkle the flour over the entire surface. Just a little flour on top like this. You can use bread flour too."
- "Bake for about 9 minutes in a 190°C oven. When the areas of dough that aren&#39;t dusted in flour begin to brown, they are finished baking."
- "Transfer the bread from the tray to a cooling rack. Handle with care because the bread is very soft."
- "They are done when they have cooled on the cooling rack!"
- "If your bread machine requires you to put the yeast and flour in the bread tin together, ensure that the yeast does not touch the salt directly."
- "Sandwiching whipped cream between this sweet, milky bread is great. Suggestion: Create a sandwich of whipped cream and blueberry jam."

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
