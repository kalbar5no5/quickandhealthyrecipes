Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
