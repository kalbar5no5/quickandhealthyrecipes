Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
