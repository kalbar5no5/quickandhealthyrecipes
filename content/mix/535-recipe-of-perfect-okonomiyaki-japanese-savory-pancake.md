How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
