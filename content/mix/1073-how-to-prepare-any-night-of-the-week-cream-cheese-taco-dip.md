Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
