Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
