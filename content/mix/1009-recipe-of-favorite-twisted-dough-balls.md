Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
