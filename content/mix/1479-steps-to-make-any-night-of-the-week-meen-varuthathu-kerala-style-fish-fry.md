Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
