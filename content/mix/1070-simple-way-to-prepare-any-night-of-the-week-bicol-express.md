Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
