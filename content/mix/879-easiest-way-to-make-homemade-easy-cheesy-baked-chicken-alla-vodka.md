Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
