Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
