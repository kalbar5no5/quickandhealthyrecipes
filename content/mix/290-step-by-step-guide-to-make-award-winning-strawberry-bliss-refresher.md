Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you want to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
