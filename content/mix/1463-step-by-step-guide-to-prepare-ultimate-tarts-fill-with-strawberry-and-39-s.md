TIP: Placing empty shells into a cupcake pan or carrier helps to prevent breakage while you fill them and also makes them easy to transport. To make strawberry tarts, fill the base with the whipped cream, then place a strawberry (or strawberries, depending on the size of the base and berries.) Next, coat the strawberries with glaze. Serve immediately or keep in fridge until ready to serve. 

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
