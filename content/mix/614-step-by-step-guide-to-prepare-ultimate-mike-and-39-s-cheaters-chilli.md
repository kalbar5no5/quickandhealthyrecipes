- "Authors Note: If you choose to add meat, fry the meat and drain it first before adding it to your chili. Fry and add meat at the beginning of your boil."
- "Authors Note: If you do decide on adding several other ingredients to your chili, you&#39;ll DEFINITELY need to add additional chili powder to taste. Start with 1 tablespoon to your simmer, mix, taste, then add additional chili powder 1 teaspoon at a time until you&#39;ve reached an acceptable level. Do the same with your Baking Soda [only if your chili has a metallic aftertaste] but 1/4 teaspoon by 1/4 teaspoon."

Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
