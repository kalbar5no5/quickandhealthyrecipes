Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
