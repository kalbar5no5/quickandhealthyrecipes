Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
