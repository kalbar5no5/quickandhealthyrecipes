Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
