Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
