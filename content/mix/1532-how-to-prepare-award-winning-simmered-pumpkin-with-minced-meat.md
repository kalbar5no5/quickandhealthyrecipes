How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
