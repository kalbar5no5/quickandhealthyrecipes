Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
