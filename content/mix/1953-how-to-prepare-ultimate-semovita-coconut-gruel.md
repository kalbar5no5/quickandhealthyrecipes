Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
