Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You need to make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
