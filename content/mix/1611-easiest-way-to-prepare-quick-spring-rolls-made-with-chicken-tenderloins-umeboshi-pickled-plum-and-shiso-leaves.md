Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
