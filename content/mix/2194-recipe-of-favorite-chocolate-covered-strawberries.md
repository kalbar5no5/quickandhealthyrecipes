Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
