Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
