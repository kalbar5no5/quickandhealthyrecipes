How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
