Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
