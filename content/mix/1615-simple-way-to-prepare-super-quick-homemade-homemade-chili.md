Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
