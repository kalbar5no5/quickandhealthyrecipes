Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
