Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
