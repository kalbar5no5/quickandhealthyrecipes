Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
