Hello everybody, it's John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to make a special dish, homemade golgappa. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Homemade golgappa is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Homemade golgappa is something which I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

The golgappa pani or spicy water is made of mint leaves in some places and in some places its jaljeera pani or hing pani or amchur (dried mango) pani. The meetha pani is the usual sweet tamarind chutney. In this post I have shared jaljeera made from mint leaves and spices. Puri for Pani Puri or Puchka Puri is a fried puffed crispy puri that makes the base of the Pani Puri.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have homemade golgappa using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

The puris are SO CRUNCHY (watch the video to hear that crunch). When I serve Pani Puri, it becomes a food experience rather than just another meal! Anyone wants golguppe, or as I say pani puri, or as it&#39;s also called puchka?! Store bought Golgappa Puris (puri for pani puri) are generally large and very hard and ruins the excitement just after few mouthfuls. However, with this step by step photo recipe of golgappa puri, making right sized melt in the mouth puris for panipuri at home is super easy. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
