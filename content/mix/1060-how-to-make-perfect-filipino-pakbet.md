Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
