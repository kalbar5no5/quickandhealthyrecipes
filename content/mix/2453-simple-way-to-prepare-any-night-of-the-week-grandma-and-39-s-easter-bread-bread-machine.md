Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body.
