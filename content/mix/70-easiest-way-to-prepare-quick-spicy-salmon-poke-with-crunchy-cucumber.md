How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
