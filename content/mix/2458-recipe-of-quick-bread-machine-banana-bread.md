How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
