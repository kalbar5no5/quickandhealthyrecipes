Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
