Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
