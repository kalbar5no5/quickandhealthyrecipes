Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
