Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
