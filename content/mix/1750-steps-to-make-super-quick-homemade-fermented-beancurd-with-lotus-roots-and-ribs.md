Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
