Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
