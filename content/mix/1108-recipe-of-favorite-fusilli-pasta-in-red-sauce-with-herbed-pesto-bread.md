Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
