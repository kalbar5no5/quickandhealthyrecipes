In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs and sour cream, if using, until frothy. When butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and add beaten. Finely ground white pepper is traditionally used in French-style scrambled eggs, omelets, and cream sauces because it blends in. Black pepper is a fine substitution.; Additional ingredients, especially ones with a lot of moisture in them like tomatoes or onions, can throw off the timing, and your eggs can come out watery. Don&#39;t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
