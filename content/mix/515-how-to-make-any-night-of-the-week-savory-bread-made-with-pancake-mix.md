Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Test out  these tips  instead!
