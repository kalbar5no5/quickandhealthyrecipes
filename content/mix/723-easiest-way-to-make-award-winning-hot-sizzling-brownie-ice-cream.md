Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at beating back depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
