Hello everybody, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, shredded beef sauce. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

I&#39;ve also used blade steak and other slow cooking pieces, which worked well also but I found that I had to add extra olive oil to the dish. In the slow cooker, mix the barbeque sauce, honey, steak seasoning, cumin, onion powder, and garlic powder. Cut steak into thin strips and place in a bowl with the wine, aminos, and cornstarch, set aside. Mix all ingredients for hot garlic sauce together then pour into a skillet and bring to a boil stirring occasionally.

Shredded beef sauce is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Shredded beef sauce is something that I've loved my entire life.

Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
