Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at combating depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
