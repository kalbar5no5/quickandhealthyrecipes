Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
