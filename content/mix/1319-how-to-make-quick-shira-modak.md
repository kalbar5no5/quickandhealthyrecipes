Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
