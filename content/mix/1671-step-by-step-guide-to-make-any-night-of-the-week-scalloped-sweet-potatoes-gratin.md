Yukon gold potatoes: I prefer these to Russets because of their nice creamy texture and buttery flavor. Use half sweet potatoes: I also love making a version of this dish with half Yukon gold and half sweet potatoes. I wondered whether sweet potatoes would work in place of potatoes… Turns out, they work very well! Whilst the potato version is starchy and comforting Then the hardest part is waiting for it to cook in the oven!

Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
