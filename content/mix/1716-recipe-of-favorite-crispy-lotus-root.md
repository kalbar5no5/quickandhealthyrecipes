Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
