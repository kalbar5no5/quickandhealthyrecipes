Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
