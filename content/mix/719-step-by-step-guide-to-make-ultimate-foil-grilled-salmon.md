Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
