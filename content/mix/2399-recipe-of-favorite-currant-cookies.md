Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
