Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!
