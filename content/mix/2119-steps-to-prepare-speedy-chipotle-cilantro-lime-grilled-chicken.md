Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
