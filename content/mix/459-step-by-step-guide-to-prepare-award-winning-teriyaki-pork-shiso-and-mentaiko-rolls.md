Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
