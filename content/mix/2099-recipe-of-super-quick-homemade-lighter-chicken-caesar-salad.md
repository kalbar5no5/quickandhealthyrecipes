Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
