Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become better. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
