Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
