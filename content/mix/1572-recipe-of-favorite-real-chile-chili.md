Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood.

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body.
