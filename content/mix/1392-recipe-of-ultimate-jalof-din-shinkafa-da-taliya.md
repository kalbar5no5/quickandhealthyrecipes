Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should stay away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
