Shrimp paste or bagoong are fermented krill, which are small crustaceans that resembles a shrimp.

Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
