Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
