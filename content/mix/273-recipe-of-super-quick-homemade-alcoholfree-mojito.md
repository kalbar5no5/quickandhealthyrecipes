Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
