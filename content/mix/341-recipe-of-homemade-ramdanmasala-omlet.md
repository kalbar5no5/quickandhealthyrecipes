Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
