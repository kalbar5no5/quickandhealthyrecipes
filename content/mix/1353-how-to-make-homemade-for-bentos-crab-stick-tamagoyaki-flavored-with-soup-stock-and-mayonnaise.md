Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very healthy and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
