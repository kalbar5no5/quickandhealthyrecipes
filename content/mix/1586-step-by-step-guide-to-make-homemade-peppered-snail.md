Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
