Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
