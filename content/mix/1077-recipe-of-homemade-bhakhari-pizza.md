Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
