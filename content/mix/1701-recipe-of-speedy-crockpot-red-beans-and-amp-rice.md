Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
