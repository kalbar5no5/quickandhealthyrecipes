Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
