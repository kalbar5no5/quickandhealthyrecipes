Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
