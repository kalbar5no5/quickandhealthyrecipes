Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
