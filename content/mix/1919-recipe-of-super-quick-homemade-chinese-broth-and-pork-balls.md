Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
