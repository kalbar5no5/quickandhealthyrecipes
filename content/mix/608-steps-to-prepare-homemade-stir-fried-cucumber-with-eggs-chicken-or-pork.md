Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
