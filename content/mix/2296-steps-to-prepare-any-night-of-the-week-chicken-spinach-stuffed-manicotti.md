Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
