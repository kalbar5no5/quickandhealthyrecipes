Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
