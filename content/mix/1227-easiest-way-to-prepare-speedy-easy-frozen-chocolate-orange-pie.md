Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
