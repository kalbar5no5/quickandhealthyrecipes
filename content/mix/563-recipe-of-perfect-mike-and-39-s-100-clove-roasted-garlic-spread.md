Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
