Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are fantastic at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
