Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
