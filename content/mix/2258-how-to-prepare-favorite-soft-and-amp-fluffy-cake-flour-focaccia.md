Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
