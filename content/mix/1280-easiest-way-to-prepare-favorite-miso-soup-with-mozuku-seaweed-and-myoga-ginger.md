Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
