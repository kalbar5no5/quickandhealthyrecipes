Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
