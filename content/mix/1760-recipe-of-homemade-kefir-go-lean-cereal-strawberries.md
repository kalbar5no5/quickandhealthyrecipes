Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
