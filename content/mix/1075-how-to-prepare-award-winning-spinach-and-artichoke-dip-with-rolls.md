Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
