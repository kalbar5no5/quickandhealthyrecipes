Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
