How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
