Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
