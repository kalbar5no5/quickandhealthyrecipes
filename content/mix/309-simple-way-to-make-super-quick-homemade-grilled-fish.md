Even if assertive fish like sardines aren&#39;t typically your thing, the mellowed flavor that they take on when grilled—not to mention that crisp skin—might change your mind. The easiest method of all is to grill your fish on a plank. A plank is simply a slab of wood, usually cedar, but sometimes oak, maple, cherry or apple. A nicely charred exterior that envelops the smooth and luscious texture of the fish.

A plank is simply a slab of wood, usually cedar, but sometimes oak, maple, cherry or apple. A nicely charred exterior that envelops the smooth and luscious texture of the fish. Fish such as tuna, salmon, halibut, and swordfish, whose texture is more like beef or pork, should be grilled. Cooking fish on the grill is a great way to serve up some serious flavor in no time, not to mention that there are many health benefits of eating fish. Even with taking precautions to keep the meat from sticking, though, grilling delicate pieces of fish can be a risky business. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. There are some foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
