Foods That Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these hints  instead!
