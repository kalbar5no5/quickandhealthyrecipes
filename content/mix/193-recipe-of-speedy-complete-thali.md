Foods That Can Make You Happy


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
