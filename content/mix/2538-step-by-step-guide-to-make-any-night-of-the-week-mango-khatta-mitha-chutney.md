Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
