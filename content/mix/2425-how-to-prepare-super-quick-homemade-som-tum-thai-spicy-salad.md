How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
