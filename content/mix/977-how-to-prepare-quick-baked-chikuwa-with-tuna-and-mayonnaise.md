Foods That Make You Happy


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
