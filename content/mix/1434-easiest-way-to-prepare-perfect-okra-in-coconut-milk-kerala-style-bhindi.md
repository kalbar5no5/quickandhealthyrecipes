Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
