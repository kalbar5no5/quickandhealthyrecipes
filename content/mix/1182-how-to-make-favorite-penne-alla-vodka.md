Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
