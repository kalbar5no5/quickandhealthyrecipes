recipeingredient:
- "4 pds sausage"
- "1 whole large chicken"
- "2 c lump crab meat optional"
- "2 packets dried shrimp optional"
- "1 large onion"
- "1 bell pepper"
- "3 stalks celery with leafy ends"
- "8 cloves garlic"
- "3 knorr chicken bouillon cubes"
- "1 tbsp salt at least"
- "1 tbsp pepper at least"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1/2 smoked paprika"
- "4 bay leaves"
- " For the roux"
- "2 cups flour"
- "1 3/4 cups vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place chicken in large pot, cover with water and bring to boil, lower heat and simmer for 45 minutes. If you boil a chicken too aggressively the meat will be tough. Low and slow yields a more tender meat. When chicken is done remove from pot and set aside (lightly covered). Skim broth and remove any bits of fat or bone. Set aside for later use."
- "Dice all of your vegetables and place in a large bowl together. Set aside."
- "If you are using a sausage with high fat content (such as pork), you want saute them until grease is brought out and set aside on some paper towels (underneath and on top) to drain. I use venison, which is a very lean sausage, so I skip this step."
- "In small pot, cover 8 eggs with one inch of water and bring to boil,cook for 7 minutes then place eggs in ice water bath. When cool, peel and set aside."
- "In a large Dutch oven, heat your vegetable oil on medium high. When it begins to ripple, drop a little bit of your flour onto it. If it immediately begins frying, your oil is ready. Add your flour 1/2 cup at a time and stir into oil until all has been used. Lower heat to medium low and stir continuously until roux is the color of milk chocolate. This takes time! Sometimes I am stirring my roux for up to 40 minutes. Store bought roux is available if you want to skip this step, I don&#39;t recommend"
- "Add all of your vegetables to the roux and continue to stir for one minute."
- "Add the broth from your chicken and add water until it reaches 9 quarts. Raise heat to high. Your roux will not incorporate into broth until it starts to boil. Stir occasionally until this happens."
- "Add your sausage and shrimp to boiling pot. Bring to boil again, then lower heat to simmer for 30 minutes."
- "Add crab meat and eggs. Simmer for 10 more minutes."
- "While gumbo is simmering, debone the chicken, add to pot and stir gently. Take pot off of heat and let it sit for 8 minutes, covered."
- "I serve mine over rice with potato salad on the side."

Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
