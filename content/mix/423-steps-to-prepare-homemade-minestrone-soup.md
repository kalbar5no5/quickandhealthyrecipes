Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
