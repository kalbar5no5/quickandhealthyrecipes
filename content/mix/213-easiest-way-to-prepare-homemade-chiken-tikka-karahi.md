Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
