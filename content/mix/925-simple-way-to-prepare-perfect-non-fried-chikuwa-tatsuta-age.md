Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
