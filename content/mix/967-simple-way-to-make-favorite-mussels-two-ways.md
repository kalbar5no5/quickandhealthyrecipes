recipeingredient:
- "1 Ke Mussels"
- " In broth"
- "2-3 inches Ginger"
- "1/4 head garlic"
- "1 medium onion"
- "2-3 stevia 2g packets or 12 Sprite"

- "2 Tbsp Cooking oil"
- "to taste Pepper"

recipeinstructions:
- "Remove beard and clean mussels well with a toothbrush under running water. Scrape off any white spots with a knife."
- "In a pot, heat oil and saut√© the onions, garlic and ginger."
- "Once onions are translucent, place 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, drop in mussels, add enough water to reach the mussels on top of the pot (water would depend on your pot size. Less water = more flavour). Sprinkle some fresh ground pepper and a dash of salt. Cover."
- "Simmer until shells open. Remove any scum rising to the top. Remove any shells that did not open. At this point you can choose shells for your Baked Mussels dish and set aside."
- "MAKING YOUR BROTH DISH: Continue simmering the pot. Add your fish sauce and Sprite or stevia (if sugar free is preferred). Taste and adjust according to desired saltiness (add more fish sauce) and ginger spiciness. Once achieved you can add your chilli leaves and simmer 2-3 minutes more. Taste and notice the difference, delicious!"
- "MAKING YOUR BAKED DISH: In an oven pan arrange your half shells. Add or insert butter slices to each mussel. Top with chopped garlic and a slice or shredded cheese. Another way is to add your garlic to mashed butter. This cooks the garlic better when you top it to the mussels."
- "Heat in oven until butter bubbles and cheese melts. Remember, this is already cooked so don&#39;t leave it too long, meat might get tough. (In picture: the brown ones, I added Korean bean/chilli paste just to try it). üëç"

Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
