Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. You must be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
