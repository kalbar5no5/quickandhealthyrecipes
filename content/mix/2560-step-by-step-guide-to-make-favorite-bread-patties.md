How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
