Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try some of these instead!
