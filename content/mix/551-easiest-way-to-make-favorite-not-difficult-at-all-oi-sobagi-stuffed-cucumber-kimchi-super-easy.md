Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
