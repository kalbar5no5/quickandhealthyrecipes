Continuing the whisking, slowly add the melted butter, then the milk. Rusks are dry, hard biscuits or twice-baked bread that are used for everything from Greek-style bruschetta to teething snacks. It is easy to make rusks from regular bread, but because you need to use low oven temperatures, it takes a whileâ€”three to five hours depending on the bread you use. Place a slice of Swiss cheese over each piece of bread. Place a half slice each of ham, Swiss cheese, smoked turkey, and provolone cheese onto each roll bottom. 

How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
