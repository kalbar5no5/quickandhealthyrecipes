Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to find out, are wonderful at battling depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
