How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
