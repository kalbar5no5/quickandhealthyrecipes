Turn off Red Sauce and allow meatballs to sit fully submerged in the sauce covered by a tight lid. Do not mix or you&#39;ll chance breaking up your meatballs. When you&#39;re ready to serve, simply heat dish up in the same pot. If you must stir, use a large, wide spoon and gently lift meatballs from the bottom and turn. Serve on top of pasta noodles. Also, serve with fresh garlic bread."
- "If you&#39;re making Meatball Subs, gently slice your warm meatballs in half (as so they sit flat and balanced on your bread) and place them on top Provolone Cheese on your Hoggie Bread. Then ladle your Meatballs with your boiling Red Sauce. Top with Parmesan Cheese, peppers and Tabasco if desired. There&#39;s no need to submerge your meatballs in sauce if making Subs however, if there are any leftovers (which there never is!) they should be added to the sauce for an additional use."

This easy meatball subs recipe is the BEST! Saucy meatlballs and melted provolone cheese on a toasted bun is the perfect make ahead meal. Meatball subs are comfort food at its finest with saucy homemade meatballs topped with melted cheese on toasted buns — what more could you want?

Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
