recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "50 grams Rye flour"
- "85 grams Milk"
- "85 grams Water"
- "20 grams Brown sugar or white sugar"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "4 1/2 grams Dry yeast"
- "40 grams Walnuts"
- "80 grams Mixed dried fruit"
recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the walnuts in a dry frying pan, being careful not to let them burn. Alternatively bake them for about 15 minutes in a 150°C oven while keeping an eye on them. Let them cool down completely, then chop up."
- "Put all the ingredients except the ones marked ● in a bread machine. When the &#34;add additions&#34; signal goes off, add the ● ingredients. (I used a finely ground rye flour.)"
- "Make sure the dough has risen properly. If it hasn&#39;t risen enough yet, leave to rise for a few more minutes. If you poke the dough with a flour-covered finger and the hole doesn&#39;t fill back in it&#39;s good."
- "After making sure the dough has risen enough, take it out of the bread machine and round it off. Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out clean, moistened kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes (see third photo)."
- "Dust the bread mold evenly with flour using a tea strainer (not listed in the ingredient list). Deflate and round off the dough, and put it in the mold with the seam side facing up."
- "See how the dough is rising, and preheat the oven to 250°C (heat the baking sheet too). Let the dough rise to almost twice its original volume."
- "Holding the baking sheet with one hand, flip the dough over into the panetton basket. Slash the top of the dough, and mist with water. Lower the oven temperature to 220°C, and bake for 10 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 200°C and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes."
- "If it looks like the top is getting burned, cover the top with a double or triple layer of foil."
- "It&#39;s packed with dried fruit and walnuts. It goes well with wine. It&#39;s delicious spread with cream cheese, butter or honey."
- "Here I divided the dough into 4 and baked them in a coupe shape. They are smaller and cuter. Form the dough into round rolls or any shape you like."
- "When the weather is hot and you use a bread machine, use room temperature water. When the weather is cold use lukewarm water, or the yeast will not mix in properly."
- "For hand-kneading directions, see."

Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you would like to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
