Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
