Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
