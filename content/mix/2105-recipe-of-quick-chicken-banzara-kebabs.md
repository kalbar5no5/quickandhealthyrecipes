Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are great at combating depression. You should make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
