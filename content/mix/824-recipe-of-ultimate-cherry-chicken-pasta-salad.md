How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
