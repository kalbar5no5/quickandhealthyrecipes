How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
