How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
