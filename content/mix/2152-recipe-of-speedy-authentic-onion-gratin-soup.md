Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!
