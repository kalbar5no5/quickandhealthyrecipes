Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
