Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
