Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
