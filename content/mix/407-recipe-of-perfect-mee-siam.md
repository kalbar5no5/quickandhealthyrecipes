Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier as well!
