How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating some eggs to cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
