Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
