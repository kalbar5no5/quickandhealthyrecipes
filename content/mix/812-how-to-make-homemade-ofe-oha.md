Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
