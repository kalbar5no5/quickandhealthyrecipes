Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
