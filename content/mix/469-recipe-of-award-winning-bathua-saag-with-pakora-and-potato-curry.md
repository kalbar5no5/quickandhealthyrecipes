Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
