Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
