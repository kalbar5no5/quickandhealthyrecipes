Use Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
