Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
