Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
