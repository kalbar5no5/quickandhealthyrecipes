Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
