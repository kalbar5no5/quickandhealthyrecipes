Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
