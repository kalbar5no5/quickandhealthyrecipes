Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
