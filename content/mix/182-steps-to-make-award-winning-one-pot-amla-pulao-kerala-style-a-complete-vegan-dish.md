How to Boost Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for improving your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
