Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you know that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
