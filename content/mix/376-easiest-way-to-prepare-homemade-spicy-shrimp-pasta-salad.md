Cook pasta according to directions on box. Drain and rinse with cold water. Typically southern Shrimp Pasta Salad is made with mayo (or in a pinch, bottled Italian salad dressing). I ditched both in favor of protein-rich Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt is just as creamy as mayo, but it&#39;s healthy and gives the Shrimp Pasta Salad a pleasant tang. 

Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
