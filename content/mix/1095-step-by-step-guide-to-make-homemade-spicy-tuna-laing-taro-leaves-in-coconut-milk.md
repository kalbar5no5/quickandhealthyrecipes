Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
