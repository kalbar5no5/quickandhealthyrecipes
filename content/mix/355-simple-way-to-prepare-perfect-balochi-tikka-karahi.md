Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
