Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  these tips  instead!
