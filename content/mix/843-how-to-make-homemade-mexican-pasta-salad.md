Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to learn, are terrific at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
