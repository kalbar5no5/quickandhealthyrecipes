How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are terrific at combating depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
