Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
