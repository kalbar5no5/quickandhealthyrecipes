Hey everyone, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, tacos. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Tacos is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It is appreciated by millions every day. They're fine and they look wonderful. Tacos is something that I've loved my entire life.

A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole. You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Tacos always keep the family running home for dinner. Here&#39;s a new take on classic pulled chicken tacos, with a hint of sweet orange, tangy lime and savory soy sauce.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tacos using 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

Hatch chiles are a staple ingredient in my home state of Texas, and this was the very first recipe that I conquered with them. Mix and match your favorite toppings—salsa and avocado would be perfect additions. —Deborah Jamison, Austin, Texas DIRECTIONS.

Cook meat, onion, garlic and cilantro stirring often til meat is no longer pink. When it comes to Taco Tuesday, we don&#39;t mess around. Vegetarians, we&#39;ve got ones for you, too. Classic fish tacos often feature deep-fried fish, a corn tortilla, cabbage and a thin mayo-based sauce. But we found that fish + pita bread = total yumminess in this streamlined version using lemon-flavored fish with a Cajun twist. 

How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
