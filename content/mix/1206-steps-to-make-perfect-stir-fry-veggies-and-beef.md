Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super healthy and good for you. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
