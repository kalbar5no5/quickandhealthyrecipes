Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
