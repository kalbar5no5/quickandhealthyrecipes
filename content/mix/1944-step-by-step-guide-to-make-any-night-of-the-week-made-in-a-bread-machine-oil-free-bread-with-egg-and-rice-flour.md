Use Food to Boost Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
