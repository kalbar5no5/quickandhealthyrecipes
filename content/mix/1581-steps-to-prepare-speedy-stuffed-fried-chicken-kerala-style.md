Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for raising your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
