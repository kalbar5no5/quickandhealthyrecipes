Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at combating depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you know green tea can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
