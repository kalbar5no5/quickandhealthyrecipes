Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Try consuming some eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
