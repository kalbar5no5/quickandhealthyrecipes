Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
