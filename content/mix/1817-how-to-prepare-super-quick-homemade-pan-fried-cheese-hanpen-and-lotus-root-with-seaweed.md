Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. You should see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
