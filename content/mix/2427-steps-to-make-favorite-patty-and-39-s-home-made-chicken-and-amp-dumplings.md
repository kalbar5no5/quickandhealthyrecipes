Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
