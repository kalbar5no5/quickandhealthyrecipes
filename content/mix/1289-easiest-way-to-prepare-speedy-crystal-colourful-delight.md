Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are fantastic at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
