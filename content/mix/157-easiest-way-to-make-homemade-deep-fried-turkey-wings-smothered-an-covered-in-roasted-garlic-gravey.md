Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
