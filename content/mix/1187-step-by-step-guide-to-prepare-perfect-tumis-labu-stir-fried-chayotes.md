Hello everybody, it's me, Dave, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, tumis labu / stir fried chayotes. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Tumis Labu / Stir Fried Chayotes is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look wonderful. Tumis Labu / Stir Fried Chayotes is something that I've loved my entire life.

Heat the oil in a pan. Add in the galics and chillies. Then add in the water and seasonings. The literal translation to tumis is stir fry, but I don&#39;t think it is really appropriate for this dish since it is so wet and has lots of sauce, more like broth or stew than a stir fry.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook tumis labu / stir fried chayotes using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

<!--inarticleads1-->

##### The ingredients needed to make Tumis Labu / Stir Fried Chayotes:

1. Make ready 8 baby chayotes, cut into sticks
1. Get 2 garlics, slice
1. Take 5 red curly chillies, slice
1. Make ready  Some water
1. Take  Oil for frying
1. Take  Salt
1. Take  Pepper
1. Prepare  Chicken powder


In a heated wok, add oil and then ginger and salt. Chayotes can be eaten with or without the skin, but for casseroles or stir-fry dishes, peeled chayote is usually called for. A vegetable peeler works well to skin them, but hold them under running water as you do so, or wear gloves. Chayotes produce a substance that can be slightly irritating to the skin.

Cut the chayote into pieces, the shallots, the garlic and the keriting into thin slices. Then add the chayote and fry until soft. Then add the taoco, the salt, the pepper, the palmsugar and the water and fry until done. 

Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
