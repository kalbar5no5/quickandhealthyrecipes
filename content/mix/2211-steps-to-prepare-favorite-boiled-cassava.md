Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin.

Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
