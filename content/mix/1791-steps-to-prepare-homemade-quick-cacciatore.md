Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try consuming a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
