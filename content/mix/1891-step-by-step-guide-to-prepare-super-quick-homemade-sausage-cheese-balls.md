Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
