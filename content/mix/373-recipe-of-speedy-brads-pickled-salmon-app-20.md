Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
