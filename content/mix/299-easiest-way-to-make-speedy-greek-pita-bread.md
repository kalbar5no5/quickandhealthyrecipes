Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
