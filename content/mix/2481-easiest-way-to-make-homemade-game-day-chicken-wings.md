Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  tips  instead.
