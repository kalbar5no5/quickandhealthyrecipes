Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
