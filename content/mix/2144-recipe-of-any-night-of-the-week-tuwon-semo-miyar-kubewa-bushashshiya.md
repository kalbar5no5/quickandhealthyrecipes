Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
