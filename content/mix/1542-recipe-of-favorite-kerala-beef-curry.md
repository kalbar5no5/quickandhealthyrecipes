Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know it can help raise your mood also!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
