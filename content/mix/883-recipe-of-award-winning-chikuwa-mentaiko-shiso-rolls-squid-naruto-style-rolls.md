Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we should avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
