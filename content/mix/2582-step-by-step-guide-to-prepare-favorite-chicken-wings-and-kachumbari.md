Learn How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are great at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you drink green tea. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
