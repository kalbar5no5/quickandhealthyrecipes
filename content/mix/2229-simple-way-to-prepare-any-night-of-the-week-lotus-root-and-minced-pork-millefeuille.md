Add the grated ginger root, chopped long green onion, sake, sesame oil and the potato starch. The usual lotus roots you find are dark brown and coated in mud. However, I used white lotus root here as I find that the crunch adds variety to the minced pork. Choose the younger (smaller and lighter in colour) ones for added crispiness. On a slice of lotus root, place a teaspoon of the filling and spread. 

Use Food to Boost Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at beating back depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
