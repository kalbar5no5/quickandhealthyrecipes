Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Some foods honestly do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at beating back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  these hints  instead!
