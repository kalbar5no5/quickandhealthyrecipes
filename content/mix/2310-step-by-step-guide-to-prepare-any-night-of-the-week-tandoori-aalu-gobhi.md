Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to discover, are great at battling depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
