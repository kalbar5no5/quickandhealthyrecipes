Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
