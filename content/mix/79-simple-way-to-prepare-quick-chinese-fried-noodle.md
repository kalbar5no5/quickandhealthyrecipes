Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at dealing with depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Eat some eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become so much healthier. And now you know it can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these tips  instead!
