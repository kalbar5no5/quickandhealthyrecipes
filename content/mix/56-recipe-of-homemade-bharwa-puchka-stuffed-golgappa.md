Discover How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are great at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
