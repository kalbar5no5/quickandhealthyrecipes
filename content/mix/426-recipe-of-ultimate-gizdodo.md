Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
