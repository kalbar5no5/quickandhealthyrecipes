How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
