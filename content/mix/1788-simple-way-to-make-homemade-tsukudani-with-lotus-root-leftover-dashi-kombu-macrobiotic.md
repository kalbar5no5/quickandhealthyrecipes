Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all great for elevating your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
