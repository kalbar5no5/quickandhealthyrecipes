Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!
