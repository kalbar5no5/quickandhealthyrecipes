Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
