Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
