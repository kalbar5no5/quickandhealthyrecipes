Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously elevate your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
