Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
