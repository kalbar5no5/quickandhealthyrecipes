Foods That Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed.
