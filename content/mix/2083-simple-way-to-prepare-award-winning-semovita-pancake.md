Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can really make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try several of these instead!
