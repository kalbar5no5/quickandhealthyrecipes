Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Try eating a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood as well!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
