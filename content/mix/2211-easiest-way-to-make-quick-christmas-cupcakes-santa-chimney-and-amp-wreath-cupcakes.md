Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. Several foods really do improve your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try several of these instead!
