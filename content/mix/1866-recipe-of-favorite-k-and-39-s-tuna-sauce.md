Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks particularly, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Try consuming a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
