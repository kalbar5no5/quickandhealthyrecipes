Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for raising your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for raising your mood. This is possible since these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

If you wish to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
