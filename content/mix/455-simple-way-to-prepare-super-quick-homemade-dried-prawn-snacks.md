Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we ought to keep away from them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are terrific at combating depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
