Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you improve your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
