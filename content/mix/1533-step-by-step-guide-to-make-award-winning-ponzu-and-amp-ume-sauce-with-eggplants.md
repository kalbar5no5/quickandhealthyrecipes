Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, along with bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood also!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
