Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to keep away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
