Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
