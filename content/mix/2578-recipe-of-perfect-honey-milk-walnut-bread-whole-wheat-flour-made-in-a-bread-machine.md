How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to stay away from them. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you combat depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your levels of serotonin, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
