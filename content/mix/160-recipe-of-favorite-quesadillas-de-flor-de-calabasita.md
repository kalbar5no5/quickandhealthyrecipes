Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could improve your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you would like to beat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are actually great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Go  with  these tips  instead!
