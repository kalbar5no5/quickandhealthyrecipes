recipeingredient:
- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "70 grams Bread flour"
- "90 to 100 grams Water"
- "15 grams Miso"
- "5 drops Lemon juice"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the water and miso in a small pan, and heat up until just before it begins to boil. By killing the micro-organisms in the miso this way, the dough won&#39;t be so loose and will be much easier to handle."
- "Once the miso cools down, add enough water so that the mixture comes to 105 to 115 g, because some water will have evaporated."
- "Put all the ingredients in a bread machine. Select the knead-only program, knead for 7 minutes only, then stop the program! Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl. Don&#39;t over knead this dough!"
- "Leave to rise properly, until the dough has increased by 2 1/2 to 3 times in volume. The dough will contain lots of air bubbles at this point, so wait patiently."
- "Take the dough out very gently so as not to lose those bubbles and place onto a flour dusted work surface. Round it off lightly and leave to rest for 15 minutes. If you want to divide it into 2, do so at this stage."
- "I formed the loaves into long thin baguettes following bread master Tsukakei&#39;s instructions.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144174-diagram-for-shaping-french-bread"
- "Form into shapes with canvas or something similar and leave to rise again (2nd rising). They have risen enough when they have doubled in size."
- "Preheat the oven with the baking sheets inside. Slash the tops of the loaves with a knife, mist with water, and put into the oven with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking sheet."
- "My oven doesn&#39;t have a steam function, so I put in some glass containers filled with boiling water along with the bread."
- "My oven is rather weak, so I bake it at 250 °C for 30 minutes, but please adjust the time and temperature to your own oven."
- "Baked. The slash got puffy and expanded."
- "How the inside looks. It tastes cheesy rather than like miso. It&#39;s a bit sour and has a deep flavor."
- "The air bubbles are so-so...Since it contains miso, the crumb is a bit brown. It smells rather like there&#39;s rye flour in the bread!"
- "The crust is thin and crispy, very nice."
- "I tried making this one using the autolyse method (mixing the flour and water together and letting it sit for a while before adding the yeast etc.)The bread was springy and aromatic and had a great texture."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you would like to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know it can help improve your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
