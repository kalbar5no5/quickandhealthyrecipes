Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. You must be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, along with elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
