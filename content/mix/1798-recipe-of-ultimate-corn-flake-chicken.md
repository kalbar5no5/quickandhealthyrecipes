Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel better. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
