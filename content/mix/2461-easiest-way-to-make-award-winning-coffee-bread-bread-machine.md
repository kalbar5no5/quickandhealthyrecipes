Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you combat depression. You should be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for lifting up your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--work better. Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible since these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, along with raising your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know green tea can help raise your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
