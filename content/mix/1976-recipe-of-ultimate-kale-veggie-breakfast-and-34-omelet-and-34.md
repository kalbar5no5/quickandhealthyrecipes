How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

If you want to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try some of these instead!
