1. As for the chikuwa, I use chikuwa as shown in the photo. This of course also tastes good with fried chikuwa as well. Cut the chikuwa in half around the center diagonally. If you are using longer chikuwa that of that in the photo, then it is easier to handle by cutting into thirds.
1. Making the breading. As shown in the photo, if you have just a bit of egg leftover after making tamagoyaki, then you can use it to make this. If you have it, add the ingredients into this bowl.

Make wasabi mayo: Simply combine mayonnaise, fresh lemon juice, and wasabi. The better the quality, means its usually a bit thinner and consumes better. Cheap seaweed will be a bit thicker and once the moisture gets in it, will be chewy. They figure people wont know any. Nori is the Japanese term for seaweed, in particular the pressed and salted kind that you can find at most Asian supermarkets. 

Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods really do raise your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You probably already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Try  these tips  instead!
