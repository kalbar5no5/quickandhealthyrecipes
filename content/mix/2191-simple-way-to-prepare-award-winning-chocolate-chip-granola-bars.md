Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Most of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you combat depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You likely already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try some of these instead!
