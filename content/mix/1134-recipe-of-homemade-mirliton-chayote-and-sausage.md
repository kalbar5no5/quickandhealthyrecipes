Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. Some foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
