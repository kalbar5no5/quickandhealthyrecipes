Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that basically can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Eat an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel better. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood too!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
