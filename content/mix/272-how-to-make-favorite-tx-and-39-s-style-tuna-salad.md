Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that, when you eat them, can better your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are great at battling depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you would like to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these suggestions  instead!
