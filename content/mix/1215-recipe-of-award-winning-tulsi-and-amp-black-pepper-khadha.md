Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and need to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super healthy and good for you. Several foods really do boost your mood when you consume them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
