Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are bad and to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for improving your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can really bring you down! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while at the same loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
