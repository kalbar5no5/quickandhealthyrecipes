Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that really can boost your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out some of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try several of these instead!
