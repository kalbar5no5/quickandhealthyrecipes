Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

If you want to overcome depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
