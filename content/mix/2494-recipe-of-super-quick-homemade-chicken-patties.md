Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible since these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to battle depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
