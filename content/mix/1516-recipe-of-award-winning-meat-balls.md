Try Using Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods actually do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
