Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to stay away from them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
