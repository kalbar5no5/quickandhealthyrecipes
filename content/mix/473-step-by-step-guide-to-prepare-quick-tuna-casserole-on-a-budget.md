Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are some foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. When you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to be in a better mood. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
