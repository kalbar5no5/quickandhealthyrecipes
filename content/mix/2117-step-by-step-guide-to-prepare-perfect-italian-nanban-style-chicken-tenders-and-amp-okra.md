Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to keep away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
