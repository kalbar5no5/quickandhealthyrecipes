Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. You need to be sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which boosts your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to beat back depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
