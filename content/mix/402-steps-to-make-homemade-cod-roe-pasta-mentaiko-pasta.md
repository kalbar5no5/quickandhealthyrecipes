Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at combating depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is possible because these foods have a bunch of magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you are wanting to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid referred to as L-theanine.
