How to Improve Your Mood with Food


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we have to stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can raise your moods when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein source.

If you would like to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood as well!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
