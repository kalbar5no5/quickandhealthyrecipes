Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are not good and must be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for raising your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
