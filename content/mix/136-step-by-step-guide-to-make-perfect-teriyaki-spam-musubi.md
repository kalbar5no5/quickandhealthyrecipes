Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Try eating a couple of eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially stimulates brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
