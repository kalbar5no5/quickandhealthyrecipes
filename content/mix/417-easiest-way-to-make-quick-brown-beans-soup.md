Foods That Can Make You Happy


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional boost, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are great for helping you battle depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to beat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew green tea could help you be so much healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
