Use Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we need to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. There are some foods that, when you consume them, may better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--function better. Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to get healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea helps you to elevate your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
