Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--function better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
