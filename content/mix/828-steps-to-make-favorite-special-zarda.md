Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super healthy and good for you. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

If you wish to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  hints  instead.
