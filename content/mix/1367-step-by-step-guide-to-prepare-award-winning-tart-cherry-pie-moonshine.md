Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to consume them. Some foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

If you wish to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is high in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
