Try Using Food to Boost Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. At times, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are wonderful at combating depression. You must make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that control your mood. Consume an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more of it in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
