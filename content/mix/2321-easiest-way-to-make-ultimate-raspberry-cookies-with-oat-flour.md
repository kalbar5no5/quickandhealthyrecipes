Foods That Make You Happy


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you want to battle depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight depression. 

Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try several of these instead!
