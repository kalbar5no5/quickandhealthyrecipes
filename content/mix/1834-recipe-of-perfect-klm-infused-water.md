Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we need to stay away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. At times, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you consume them, could better your mood. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you fight back depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
