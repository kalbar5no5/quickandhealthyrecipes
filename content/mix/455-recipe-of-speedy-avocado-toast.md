Use Food to Improve Your Mood


In general, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and have to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is candy or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are great at combating depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you boost your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try a few of these instead!
