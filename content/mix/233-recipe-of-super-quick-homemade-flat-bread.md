Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods really do boost your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are wonderful at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for improving your mood. This is possible as these foods have a bunch of magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more of it in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you are wanting to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. And now you are aware that green tea can help raise your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
