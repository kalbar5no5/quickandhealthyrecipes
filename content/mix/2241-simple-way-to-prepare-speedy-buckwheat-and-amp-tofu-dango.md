Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we should keep away from them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Other times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do boost your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for lifting up your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Try eating an egg and be happy!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
