Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must stay away from them. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a couple of eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you wish to defeat depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! These grains can elevate your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps raise your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
