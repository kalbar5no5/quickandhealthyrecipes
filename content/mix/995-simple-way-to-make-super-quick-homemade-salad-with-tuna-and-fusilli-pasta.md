Use Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, could boost your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel happier!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while also calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you feel better. Now you are aware that it can help improve your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
