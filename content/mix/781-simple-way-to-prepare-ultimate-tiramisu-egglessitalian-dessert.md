Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this might be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. There are several foods that basically can improve your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat a few eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! These grains can improve your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods also!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  these suggestions  instead!
