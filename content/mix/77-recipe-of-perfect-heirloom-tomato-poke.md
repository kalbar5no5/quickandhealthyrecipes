recipeinstructions:

- "Toss the soy mixture with the tomatoes."
- "Toast the nori. You can do this by waving a sheet of nori over a heat source until you feel it stiffen. It&#39;s quite noticeable when it sort of dries up and turns a bit crispy. Toasting just improves the texture and flavor of the nori."
- "Now, take your 2 sheets of toasted nori back to back and fold them like a hot dog bun. Repeat this so that you have a long strip of nori. Since it&#39;s toasted, it should break at the folds, so you&#39;ll have 8 strips of nori in a stack. Grab some kitchen scissors. holding the nori over the tomatoes, cut about 2mm off of the end of the short side. Keep doing this until the nori is all turned into these little thin strips. You can kinda see what it&#39;s supposed to look like in the picture."
- "Time to serve. But don&#39;t forget to check the flavor and see if it needs any small adjustments."

Information on How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be super nourishing and good for you. There are a number of foods that really can improve your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly great at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the egg yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! These grains can improve your mood as it's easy for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were just waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. And now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
