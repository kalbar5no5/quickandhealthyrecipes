Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


A lot of us think that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we must stay away from them. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are fantastic for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that control your mood. Eat some eggs to feel better!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are high in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that dictates to your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Nuts, on top of bettering your mood, can be a super source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly elevate your mood. 

It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Test out  these hints  instead!
