Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we have to keep away from them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Whenever you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to beat back depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
