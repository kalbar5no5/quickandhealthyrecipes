Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we need to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, could better your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you do not throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of it in your brain, the more pleasant you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! These grains can help your mood elevate as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

See, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
