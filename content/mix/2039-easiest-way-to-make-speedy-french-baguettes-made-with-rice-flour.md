How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are bad and are to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you fight depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you want to battle depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is truly good for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try several of these instead!
