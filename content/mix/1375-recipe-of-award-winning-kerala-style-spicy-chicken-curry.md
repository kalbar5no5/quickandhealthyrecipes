Foods That Can Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. There are several foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating some eggs to feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to fight depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were sure it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's focus while also relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be better. Now you know it can help raise your mood as well!

Now you realize that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you wish to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
