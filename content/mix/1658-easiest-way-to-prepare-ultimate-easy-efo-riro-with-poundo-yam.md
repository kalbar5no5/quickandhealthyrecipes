Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at dealing with depression. You must see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be improved by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you will feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. These are two things that improve the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
