Foods That Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be super nutritious and good for you. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at dealing with depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, particularly the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Eat an egg and feel better!

Make a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you would like to be in a better mood. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is rich in a particular amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

You can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
