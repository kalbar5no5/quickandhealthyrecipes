Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to eat. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because they improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to feel happier. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could truly be helped by green tea. You were sure it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this specific amino acid can actually induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while also calming the rest of your body. You already knew that green tea helps you become healthier. Now you are aware that green tea can help improve your mood too!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
