Try Using Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are bad and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods really do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you improve your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat an egg and feel happier!

Make a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all helpful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you wish to beat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that promote the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually excellent for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
