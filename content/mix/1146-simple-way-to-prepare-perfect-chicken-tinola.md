Foods That Make You Happy


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually great at dealing with depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for elevating your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Consume an egg and feel a lot happier!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you would like to be in a better mood. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can truly be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you so you can feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
