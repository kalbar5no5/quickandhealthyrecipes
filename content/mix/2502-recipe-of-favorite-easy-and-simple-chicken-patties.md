Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are terrible and are to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to learn, are fantastic at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for boosting your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly elevate your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is chock-full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know green tea can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  suggestions  instead.
