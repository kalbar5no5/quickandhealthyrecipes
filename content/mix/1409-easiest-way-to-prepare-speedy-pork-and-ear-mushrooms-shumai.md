Foods That Make You Happy


A lot of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be extremely healthy and good for you. Some foods honestly do raise your mood when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and need an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really terrific at fighting back depression. Just be sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Consume an egg and feel happier!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to battle depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you battle your depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You likely already knew it is not hard to get healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that green tea can help you be happier too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you just so to feel better! Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
