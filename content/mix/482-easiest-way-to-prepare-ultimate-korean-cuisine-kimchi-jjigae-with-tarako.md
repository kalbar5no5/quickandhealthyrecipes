Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to consume. There are some foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to discover, are terrific at fighting depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the egg yolk. When you want to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which boosts serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can actually help to make your mood better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You were just expecting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid basically stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you are aware that it can help raise your mood also!

As you can see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
