Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Most of us have been trained to believe that comfort foods are not good and are to be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be totally healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most crucial in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are great for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try consuming some eggs to jolly up!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that directs the brain how to feel at any given time. The more serotonin in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific protein food source.

If you would like to defeat depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly raise your mood. 

Grains can be wonderful for fighting a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You were simply anticipating to read that in this article, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually stimulates brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be better. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you have to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Go  with  these suggestions  instead!
