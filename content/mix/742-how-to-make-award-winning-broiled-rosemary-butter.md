Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Many of us think that comfort foods are not good for us and that we should avoid them. At times, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether healthy and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that actually can raise your moods when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be actually wonderful at beating back depression. You need to see to it, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Put together several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to raise your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's not hard to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains faster than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help you be happier also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
