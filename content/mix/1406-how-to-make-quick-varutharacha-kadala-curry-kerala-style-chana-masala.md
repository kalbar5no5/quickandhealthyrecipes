Foods That Can Make You Happy


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we must avoid them. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to eat them. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel all the time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to combat depression. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your blood glucose which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you know it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
