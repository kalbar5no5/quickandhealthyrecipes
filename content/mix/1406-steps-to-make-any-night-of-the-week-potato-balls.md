Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this holds true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. Some foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and need an emotional pick-me-up, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be fantastic for raising your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixout of a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other types of nuts. This is because these foods are high in magnesium, which helps to raise serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all rich in omega-3 fats and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly raise your mood. 

Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn brings up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is truly great for your mood. You were simply anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this particular amino acid can basically stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you be better. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are bad for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
