Foods That Can Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can boost your moods when you eat them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just make sure that you do not throw out the egg yolk. Every time you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can be fantastic for boosting your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all helpful for improving your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to bettering your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3s. These are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. It's easy to feel low when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is really great for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a certain amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while at the same relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to become healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier as well!

So you see, you don't need junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try several of these instead!
