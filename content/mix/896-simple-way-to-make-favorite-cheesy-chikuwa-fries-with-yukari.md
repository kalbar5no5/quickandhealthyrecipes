Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, can boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be amazed to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most vital part of the egg. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these foods are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you wish to fight depression. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are chock full of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these grains more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were just waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps sharpen your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you feel so much healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

You can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
