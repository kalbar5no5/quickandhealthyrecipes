Foods That Make Your Mood Better


For the most part, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. There are some foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be astonished to discover, are great at fighting depression. You need to see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The yolk is the most crucial part of the egg in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for boosting your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that affect your mood. Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Put together a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is possible because these foods are high in magnesium which increases serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, particularly, are a fantastic protein food source.

Cold water fish are great if you wish to feel better. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3s and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can really help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel better. Now you know that applies to your mood also!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
