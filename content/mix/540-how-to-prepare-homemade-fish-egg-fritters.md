Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Mostly, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, may boost your mood. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you fight depression. You must see to it, though, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to elevate your mood. This is because they increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat a few eggs to feel better!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etc are all terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, on top of raising your mood, can be a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. It's easy to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is truly excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is high in a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have shown that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while calming the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood as well!

So you see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
