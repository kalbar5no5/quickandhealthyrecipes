Turn to Food to Elevate Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and must be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very nourishing and good for us to consume. There are a number of foods that really can boost your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to discover, are wonderful at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, specifically the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a great protein source.

Cold water fish are excellent if you want to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you overcome your depression. 

It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You were simply expecting to read that, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become healthier. Now you know that it helps you to lift your moods also!

You can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try some of these instead!
