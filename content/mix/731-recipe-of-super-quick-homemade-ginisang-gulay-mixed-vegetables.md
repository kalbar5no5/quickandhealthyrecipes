Discover How to Improve Your Mood with Food


In general, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and need to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that really can improve your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are fantastic for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for raising your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating an egg and be happy!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all wonderful for raising your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes your production of serotonin. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that tells your brain how you feel at all times. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you wish to combat depression. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that raise the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

Grains can be great for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you be healthier. Now you know that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are bad for you just so to feel better! Try a few of these instead!
