Use Food to Elevate Your Mood


Mostly, people have been trained to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and must be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very nutritious and good for us to eat. There are some foods that, when you eat them, may boost your mood. If you are feeling a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really great at beating back depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you would like to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most crucial part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--run better. Consume an egg and cheer up!

Put together a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is possible because these foods are rich in magnesium which increases your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more you have of it, the happier you will feel. Nuts, on top of elevating your mood, can be a super protein source.

Cold water fish are great if you are wanting to feel happier. Cold water fish including tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3 fats. These are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proved that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental acuity while relaxing the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are aware that green tea helps you to lift your moods also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a few  of  these  tips  instead.
