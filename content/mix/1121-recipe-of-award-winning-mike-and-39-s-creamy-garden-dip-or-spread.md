Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are not good for the body and must be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is made of candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. There are several foods that actually can boost your moods when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You should see to it, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can be terrific for lifting up your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etc are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel all the time. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to raising your mood, can be a super source of protein.

If you want to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all loaded with omega-3 and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is really good for your mood. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously calming the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you feel healthier. Now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you so you can feel better! Try a few of these instead!
