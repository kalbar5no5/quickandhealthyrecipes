Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


A lot of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we ought to stay away from them. At times, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be really nutritious and good for you. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not throw out the yolk. The yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be great for elevating your mood. This is because they help in improving the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try eating an egg and cheer up!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all fantastic for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are rich in magnesium, which helps to increase serotonin production. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more of it you have, the more pleasant you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great protein food source.

Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can seriously raise your mood. 

Some grains are really wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is excellent for moods. You knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is rich in an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood as well!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you wish to feel better! Try some of these instead!
