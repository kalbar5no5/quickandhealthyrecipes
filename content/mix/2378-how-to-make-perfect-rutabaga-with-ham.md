Turn to Food to Boost Your Mood


A lot of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and should be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be very nourishing and good for you. A number of foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are in need of an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to learn, are wonderful at combating depression. Just see to it that you do not throw away the yolk. When you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try eating a few eggs to cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom a variety of seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to raise your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost your production of serotonin. Serotonin is known as the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to beat back depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all full of omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a specific amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you are well aware that green tea helps you to elevate your moods also!

So you see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
