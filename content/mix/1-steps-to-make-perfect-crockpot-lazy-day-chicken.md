How to Improve Your Mood with Food


Many of us believe that comfort foods are not good for us and that we have to avoid them. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for you. There are several foods that, when you consume them, can improve your mood. If you feel a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at fighting back depression. You should make sure, however, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to boost your mood. This is because the B vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that control your mood--run better. Try eating some eggs to jolly up!

Build a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all great for helping to elevate your mood. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which promotes serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical substance that directs your brain how you feel at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a terrific protein food source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you want to fight depression. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all high in omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Grains can be great for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping increase your happiness levels. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.

Green tea is actually good for your mood. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has a lot of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Research has found that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps raise your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You already knew green tea could help you become better. Now you know that green tea helps you to raise your moods as well!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
