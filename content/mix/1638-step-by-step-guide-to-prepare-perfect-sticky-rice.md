Learn How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to believe that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. Often, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. At times, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to eat. There are a number of foods that, when you eat them, may improve your mood. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be really wonderful at dealing with depression. You must make sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and cheer up!

Make a trail mixfrom various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be elevated by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of this chemical in your brain, the happier you'll feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent for eating if you wish to battle depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3s and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's grey matter. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you overcome depression. 

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You were sure green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not difficult to be healthy when you drink green tea. Now you know green tea can help improve your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
