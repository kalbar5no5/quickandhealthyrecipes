Foods That Can Make You Happy


Most of us believe that comfort foods are bad for us and that we must stay away from them. At times, if your comfort food is basically candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be perfectly nutritious and good for us to eat. Several foods actually do improve your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to find out, are fantastic at combating depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, specifically the egg yolks, are full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you boost your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot better!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and so on. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given moment. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can greatly boost your mood. 

Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, helping you feel better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are easy for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood can really be helped by green tea. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is high in a specific amino acid called L-theanine. Studies have found that this particular amino acid can essentially induce brain waves. This helps better your mental acuity while calming the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood too!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you wish to feel better! Go  with  these hints  instead!
