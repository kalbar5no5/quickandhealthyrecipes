How to Boost Your Mood with Food


Most of us believe that comfort foods are terrible for us and that we ought to avoid them. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods can be extremely nourishing and good for you. There are several foods that basically can raise your moods when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try some of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at fighting back depression. Just make sure that you do not toss the yolk. Every time you wish to cheer yourself up, the yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolks in particular, are high in B vitamins. The B vitamin family can be terrific for elevating your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--function better. Eat a few eggs to jolly up!

Make a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Your mood can be raised by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is possible as these foods are rich in magnesium which raises serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that directs your brain how you feel day in and day out. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not just that but nuts, particularly, are a great protein food source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to combat depression. Herring, trout, tuna, wild salmon, and mackerel are all high in omega-3 fats and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight back depression. 

It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.

Green tea is actually excellent for your mood. You just knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea has been found to be rich in an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this specific amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while relaxing the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you become so much healthier. Now you are well aware that it helps you to raise your moods as well!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Test out  these suggestions  instead!
