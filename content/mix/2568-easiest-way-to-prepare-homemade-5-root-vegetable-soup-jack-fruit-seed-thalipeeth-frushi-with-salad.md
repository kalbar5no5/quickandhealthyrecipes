Foods That Make You Happy


For the most part, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and have to be avoided. At times, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this can be true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nourishing and it's good for you to consume them. Several foods honestly do raise your mood when you eat them. If you are feeling a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try a number of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are terrific for helping you battle depression. Just be sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to improve your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try eating a few eggs to jolly up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Your mood can be elevated by consuming peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera. This is because these foods are rich in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, in addition to elevating your mood, can be a great source of protein.

If you want to defeat depression, try eating some cold water fish. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all rich in omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: chomping on a tuna fish sandwich can basically help you fight depression. 

It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were sure it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with a particular amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can basically induce brain waves. This will improve your brain's concentration while simultaneously loosening up the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

So you see, you don't need to eat junk food or foods that are terrible for you to feel better! Test out  these tips  instead!
