How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


Many of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly nutritious and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do improve your mood when you consume them. If you feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you might be surprised to learn, are wonderful at battling depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. The yolk is the part of the egg that is the most important in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, particularly the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. These B vitamins are wonderful for helping to raise your mood. This is because they help in bettering the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat an egg and feel better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more of this chemical in your brain, the better you'll feel. Not only that, nuts, in particular, are a fantastic source of protein.

Cold water fish are great if you want to feel better. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can really help you overcome your depression. 

Some grains are truly wonderful for repelling bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps kick start a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were sure green tea had to be mentioned, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have found that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This will better your brain's concentration while also relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you become better. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

So you see, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
