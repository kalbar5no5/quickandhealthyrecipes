Use Food to Improve Your Mood


Mostly, people have been taught to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and should be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Other times, though, comfort foods can be altogether nutritious and it's good for you to eat them. Several foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to feel a little bit down and you're in need of a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at fighting back depression. Just see to it that you do not throw out the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you raise your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the components of your brain that dictate your mood. Try consuming a few eggs to feel better!

Make a few trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all good for elevating your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Nuts, in addition to improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are excellent if you wish to be in a better mood. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all full of omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's true: consuming a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight back depression. 

It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You were just anticipating to read that, weren't you? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This will better your brain's focus while simultaneously relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that that green tea helps you become a lot healthier. Now you know that green tea can improve your mood too!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  tips  instead.
