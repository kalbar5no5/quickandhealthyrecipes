You can&#39;t choose just any steak for the Crock Pot, though. You&#39;ll want one that&#39;ll tenderize during the cooking process to avoid becoming dry, tough, and not at all appetizing.

Foods That Make You Happy


Most of us have been conditioned to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. But if your comfort food is candy or junk food this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be extremely healthy and good for you. There are a number of foods that, when you consume them, may improve your mood. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are great for helping you battle depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are terrific for helping to elevate your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel better!

Make some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, etcetera are all great for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is referred to as the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more serotonin you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that but nuts, particularly, are a terrific source of protein.

If you would like to overcome depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etcetera, they're all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that really help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can seriously boost your mood. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be in this article somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously calming your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you be healthier. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood also!

See, you don't need to eat all that junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try several of these instead!
