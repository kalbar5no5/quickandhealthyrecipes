Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and need to be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or some other junk food, this is very true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be really nutritious and good for you. There are some foods that actually can raise your moods when you consume them. If you are feeling a little bit down and need a happiness pick me up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to find out, are fantastic at battling depression. Just be sure that you don't get rid of the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the part of the egg that matters most in terms of helping elevate your mood. Eggs, the yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can truly help you elevate your mood. This is because they help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--work better. Consume an egg and feel a lot better!

Put together some trail mix of nuts or seeds. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is the "feel good" natural substance that dictates to your brain how you feel day in and day out. The more of it you have, the better you are going to feel. Not just that, nuts, specifically, are a great protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try consuming some cold water fish. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, and so on, they're all chock-full of omega-3 and DHA. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the gray matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really excellent for helping raise your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel hungry! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood sugar which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.

Green tea is fantastic for moods. You knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is found to be packed full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies show that this specific amino acid can actually stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are aware that it helps you to raise your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to consume all that junk food when you want to feel better! Try  a few  of  these  suggestions  instead.
