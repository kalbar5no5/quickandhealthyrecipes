Discover How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been trained to think that comfort foods are not good and to be avoided. If your comfort food is candy or junk food this holds true. Otherwise, comfort foods may be super nutritious and good for you. There are a number of foods that actually can improve your moods when you consume them. When you are feeling a little down and are needing an emotional boost, test out a few of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly terrific at beating back depression. Just see to it that you do not toss the egg yolk. Every time you would like to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk especially, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can actually help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Eat an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixfrom different seeds and nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all helpful for raising your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have a lot of magnesium which increases your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that dictates to the brain how to feel at any given time. The higher your serotonin levels, the better you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic protein source.

Cold water fish are good if you wish to feel happier. Salmon, herring, tuna fish, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all chock-full of omega-3s and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain function a lot better. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. These foods fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. It's easy to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Your mood could actually be helped by green tea. You knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is rich in a certain amino acid called L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid induces the production of brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time calming your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. Now you know that applies to your mood as well!

So you see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Test out  these hints  instead!
