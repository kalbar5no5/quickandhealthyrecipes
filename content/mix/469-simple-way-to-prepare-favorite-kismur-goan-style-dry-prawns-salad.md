Information on How to Improve Your Mood with Food


For the most part, people have been conditioned to think that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. However, if your comfort food is candy or junk food this can be true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to eat. Several foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be surprised to discover, are fantastic at combating depression. Just make sure that you don't throw away the yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg in terms of helping raise your mood. Eggs, the egg yolks especially, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that affect your mood--work better. Try eating an egg and jolly up!

Put together a trail mixout of different seeds and nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to increase your production of serotonin. Serotonin is a feel-good substance that directs the brain how to feel at any given point in time. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Nuts, along with improving your mood, can be a super protein source.

If you wish to fight depression, try eating some cold water fish. Cold water fish like tuna, trout and wild salmon are rich in DHA and omega-3s. These are two substances that boost the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping boost your happiness levels. They help you feel full also which can actually help to improve your mood. It's not difficult to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were just anticipating to read that here, weren't you? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has proven that this amino acid promotes the production of brain waves. This helps better your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You were already aware that green tea could help you become healthier. And now you are aware that it can help you be happier also!

Now you can see that junk food isn't necessarily what you need to eat when you are wanting to help your moods get better. Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
