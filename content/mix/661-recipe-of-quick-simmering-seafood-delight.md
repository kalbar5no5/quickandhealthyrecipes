Foods That Can Make Your Mood Better


In general, people have been taught to believe that "comfort" foods are bad for the body and should be avoided. At times, if the comfort food is candy or another junk food, this is very true. Other times, however, comfort foods can be completely nutritious and it's good for you to consume them. A number of foods actually do boost your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you need an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, you may be astonished to find out, are great at fighting depression. Just be sure that you do not toss the yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the yolk in particular, are high in B vitamins. B vitamins can really help you raise your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that dictate how you feel). Try to eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Build a trail mix from seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all wonderful for elevating your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have plenty of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical substance that tells the brain how to feel at any given time. The more you have of it, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that but nuts, in particular, are a great source of protein.

Cold water fish are good if you want to be in a better mood. Cold water fish such as tuna, trout and wild salmon are high in DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. DHA and omega-3s are two things that promote the quality and the function of your brain's gray matter. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can really help you fight your depression. 

Some grains are really wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can actually help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Your mood could really be helped by green tea. You just knew green tea had to be included in this article, right? Green tea has been found to be chock-full of an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid essentially induces brain waves. This helps raise your mental focus while calming the rest of your body. You probably already knew it is not hard to become healthy when you consume green tea. Now you know that green tea can elevate your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you to feel better! Try  a  couple of  of  these  hints  instead.
