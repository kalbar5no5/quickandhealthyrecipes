Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


Most of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are bad and must be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is essentially candy or other junk foods, this is true. Otherwise, comfort foods could be very nutritious and good for you. Some foods honestly do improve your mood when you eat them. If you seem to be a little bit down and you're needing an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, are terrific for helping you combat depression. You need to be sure, though, that what you make includes the yolk. The egg yolk is the most important part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping raise your mood. Eggs, especially the yolks, are loaded with B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you elevate your mood. This is because these vitamins improve the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that tell you how to feel). Try consuming some eggs to cheer up!

Make several trail mix of nuts or seeds. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, etcetera are all fantastic for helping to raise your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which raises your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that tells the brain how to feel at any given moment. The more serotonin you have, the more pleasant you will feel. Nuts, on top of improving your mood, can be a superb source of protein.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you want to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. These are two substances that increase the quality and function of the grey matter in your brain. It's the truth: consuming tuna fish sandwiches can actually help you fight your depression. 

It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is actually great for your mood. You were simply waiting to read that here, weren't you? Green tea has been found to be packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies have discovered that this amino acid actually induces brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while having a relaxing effect on the rest of your body. You knew green tea could help you be healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood also!

Now you know that junk food isn't necessarily what you should eat when you want to help your moods get better. Try  a  couple of  of  these  suggestions  instead.
