Information on How to Elevate Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to believe that comfort foods are terrible and to be avoided. Sometimes, if the comfort food is a high sugar food or some other junk food, this is true. Soemtimes, comfort foods can be utterly nourishing and good for us to consume. A number of foods honestly do elevate your mood when you eat them. When you feel a little down and are needing an emotional pick-me-up, try a couple of these.

Eggs, believe it or not, can be truly wonderful at beating back depression. Just make sure that you don't toss out the egg yolk. Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, the egg yolk is the most important part of the egg. Eggs, the egg yolk particularly, are rich in B vitamins. These B vitamins are fantastic for helping to improve your mood. This is because the B vitamins increase the function of your brain's neural transmitters (the parts of the brain that affect how you feel). Eat an egg and feel a lot happier!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and so on are all great for helping to boost your mood. This is because these nuts are high in magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is the "feel good" chemical that dictates to your brain how you feel all the time. The higher your serotonin levels, the more pleasant you will feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are great for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Wild salmon, herring, mackerel, trout, and tuna are all high in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can actually help you fight depression. 

Some grains are truly great for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. These foods fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.

Your mood can actually be helped by green tea. You knew it had to be mentioned in this article, right? Green tea is found to be chock-full of an amino acid called L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps improve your mental sharpness while relaxing the rest of your body. You likely already knew how easy it is to be healthy when you consume green tea. Now you are well aware that it helps you to elevate your moods as well!

As you can see, you don't have to turn to junk food or foods that are bad for you to feel better! Try  these suggestions  instead!
