Turn to Food to Improve Your Mood


For the most part, people have been conditioned to believe that "comfort" foods are terrible for the body and have to be avoided. Sometimes, if your comfort food is a high sugar food or another junk food, this holds true. At times, comfort foods can be very healthy and good for us to consume. A number of foods actually do raise your mood when you consume them. If you seem to be a little bit down and in need of an emotional pick me up, try several of these.

Eggs, would you believe, are wonderful for helping you fight depression. Just see to it that you don't throw away the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most crucial part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolks especially, are rich in B vitamins. B vitamins can genuinely help you improve your mood. This is because they help improve the function of your neural transmitters, the parts of your brain that dictate your mood. Eat a couple of eggs to cheer up!

Put together a trail mix out of seeds and/or nuts. Almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and so on are all good for improving your mood. This is because seeds and nuts have lots of magnesium which boosts your brain's serotonin levels. Serotonin is called the "feel good" chemical substance and it tells your brain how you should be feeling at all times. The more of it you have, the happier you are going to feel. Not just that but nuts, specifically, are a terrific protein source.

Cold water fish are wonderful for eating if you are wanting to battle depression. Salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, trout, etc, they're all loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids and DHA are two things that truly help the grey matter in your brain work a lot better. It's the truth: eating tuna fish sandwiches can truly help you battle your depression. 

It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. It's not hard to feel low when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.

Green tea is really excellent for your mood. You knew it had to be in here somewhere, right? Green tea is packed full of an amino acid known as L-theanine. Studies prove that this particular amino acid can essentially stimulate brain waves. This helps focus your mental energy while at the same time relaxing the rest of your body. You knew that green tea helps you feel healthier. And now you know it can help raise your mood too!

As you can see, you don't need junk food or foods that are not good for you just so to feel better! Try  some  of  these  hints  instead.
