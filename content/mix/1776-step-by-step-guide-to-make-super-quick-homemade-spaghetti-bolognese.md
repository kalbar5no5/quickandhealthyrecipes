Learn How to Boost Your Mood with Food


A lot of us have been taught to think that comfort foods are terrible and should be avoided. Often, if the comfort food is a sugary food or another junk food, this is true. Other times, comfort foods can be utterly healthy and good for us to consume. Several foods really do elevate your mood when you eat them. If you feel a little bit down and you need a happiness pick me up, try a few of these.

Eggs, you might be amazed to find out, are terrific at fighting depression. You need to make sure, however, that what you make includes the egg yolk. The egg yolk is the most essential part of the egg iwhen it comes to helping you cheer up. Eggs, the yolk especially, are stuffed full of B vitamins. B vitamins can be great for boosting your mood. This is because these vitamins help your neural transmitters--the parts of your brain that dictate your mood--run better. Consume an egg and be happy!

Put together a trail mixout of various seeds and nuts. Your mood can be improved by eating peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. This is because these nuts are loaded with magnesium, which helps to boost serotonin production. Serotonin is called the "feel good" substance that our body produces and it tells your brain how you should be feeling day in and day out. The higher your levels of serotonin, the happier you are going to feel. Not only that, nuts, specifically, are a fantastic source of protein.

If you want to fight depression, you should eat some cold water fish. Tuna, trout, mackerel, herring and wild salmon are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA. DHA and omega-3s are two things that actually help the grey matter in your brain run a lot better. It's true: eating a tuna fish sandwich can earnestly boost your mood. 

Some grains are actually wonderful for driving away bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! These grains can help your mood elevate since it's easy for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.

Green tea is wonderful for moods. You just knew it had to be included in this article, right? Green tea is loaded with an amino acid referred to as L-theanine. Research has discovered that this amino acid stimulates the production of brain waves. This helps improve your mental energy while simultaneously making the rest of your body more relaxed. You already knew that green tea helps you feel a lot healthier. Now you are aware that it helps you to elevate your moods too!

As you can see, you don't need to stuff your face with junk food when you are wanting to feel better! Try some of these instead!
